Five years ago getting a dog, starting a web company, working on huge projects here at Invoke all would have seemed hugely ambitious to me, but I\u2019ve done them all.\r\n\r\nBuilding an effective real-time chat that syncs perfectly between consumers and supports e-commerce would have been ambitious five years ago. But we\u2019ve just pulled it off in under a month.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve built a consumer-to-consumer (C2C) platform that, through chat, enables users to discuss their purchase, make offers, and determine shipping methods. They can accept the terms, and even generate an invoice. They can conduct business with each other without ever leaving the chat. In the past, building a chat like this would be an incredibly ambitious endeavour. But, thanks to newly available technologies, it was easy for us too.\r\n\r\nSimpler, Faster, Better\r\n\r\nIn the past, you would have needed to invest in some serious servers and work some sort of event-polling magic if you wanted your chat to have a chance of feeling nice and snappy. Now, we live in the good times. There are options like websockets and webRTC to choose from, but we opted for a service we\u2019ve used on other projects: Google Firebase.\r\n\r\nFirebase is a service for creating and syncing a real-time database across clients. One user makes a change and everyone else sees it. For our app, a user can immediately see when another user has added a message. All our data is organized in a relatively flat structure\u2014purposefully duplicating the data we think we\u2019ll need to make for simpler data queries. Simpler means faster, and faster means a better user experience.\r\n\r\nBut what really sells it for us is just how easy it is to get started. The fantastic features and vibrant development community surrounding Firebase make getting your product launched that much more efficient \u2013 in fact some large companies have also taken note and are using it. If you\u2019ve ever wondered what song was playing and decided to fire up Shazam, you\u2019ve used this tech too.\r\n\r\nA World of Integrations\r\n\r\nThe scale and community investment that comes from a Google service like Firebase means that not only do you benefit from the core features of the service, you can also easily connect and integrate with other tools. This lets us tackle complex problems at lightning speed.\r\n\r\nWe needed to be able to let users know when they have unread messages. For this, we used the Amazon Elastic Beanstalk service to deploy a Node.js server. And wouldn\u2019t you know it, Node.js has a Firebase adapter. When it is connected to our database, it listens for changes. When it notices a new message, it stamps it with the time and marks it as unread.\r\n\r\nNot only did this help us quickly to let users know about unread messages, but the Elastic Beanstalk service also helps us mitigate any problems we might accidentally create at our end. The \u201ceb\u201d command line tool makes updating code a breeze by stamping each update as a release. That way, if someone accidentally pushes buggy code to the live site, we tap a button and things revert back to normal.\r\n\r\nThis reversion capability reduces our risk and lets us frequently update and refine the products that are being powered by these tools and services. With ongoing user feedback and analytics to base our decisions on, a release isn\u2019t a big deal. We can just do it.\r\n\r\nCut the Costs\r\n\r\nNew technologies aren\u2019t just making things faster, easier, and less risky, they\u2019re also making them cheaper.\r\n\r\nThe chat product we built uses Lambda functions from AWS to schedule emails. Lambda lets us create a schedule that emails our users with any unread messages in their conversations. Why does this matter? It\u2019s because this takes advantage of \u201con-demand computing.\u201d Instead of paying to run a server 24\/7\/365, we only pay every few hours when our function runs. It\u2019s the sharing economy of computing, and it can drastically reduce the costs required to run a modern service. In a lot of cases, this could be by over 80%.\r\n\r\nSo what has the development taught us? We\u2019ve seen that technology solutions like Firebase, Elastic Beanstalk, and Lambda are making the development teams building products happier, but the benefits extend across product teams.\r\n\r\nWhen launches happen quicker, strategy and design teams can analyze how users interact with the product that much sooner and make improvements even faster.\r\n\r\nIt also means that funding and budgets are freed up to let developers test and refine code. Designers can conduct user tests, and strategists can validate product directions and roadmaps.\r\n\r\nAbove all, it means that it\u2019s now that much easier to determine exactly where our product is, and what new heights we\u2019ll be able to reach next.\r\n\r\nShare Share Email +1 Shares 157","title":"Product Development: Turning Months Into Weeks","url":"http:\/\/www.mindtheproduct.com\/2017\/07\/product-development-turning-months-weeks\/","labels":["company growth","product discovery","product growth","product management","sales"]},{"body":"","title":" Mergers and Acquisitions: A Complete Guide ","url":"https:\/\/www.cleverism.com\/mergers-and-acquisitions-complete-guide\/","labels":["sales"]},{"body":"With digital media always changing, it's important for startups to constantly keep abreast of the best marketing strategies. And that's why marketing expert and friend of the Founder Institute Shivankit Arora has written this guest post that outlines the basic strategies a startup can employ to increase their internet presence.\r\n\r\nGrowth hacking has been riding the tide in the startup world for a while. While the phrase has been used by marketers more often than before, most of them still limit the concept to search engine optimization, email automation and social media marketing strategy etc.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not what defines growth hacking.\r\n\r\nGrowth Hacking refers to a set of marketing channels that will trigger your business growth in a data driven and cost effective fashion. A successful growth hack comprises the following:\r\n\r\nBrainstorming and experimenting with a number of hypotheses to come down to a marketing strategy to take your startup to the next level.\r\n\r\nContinuously optimising your efforts, CPAs and and user retention with the discovered hacks.\r\n\r\nNow that we understand what growth hacking is all about let\u2019s have a look into the growth hacking funnel or what it is popularly known as \u201cstartup marketing funnel\u201d.\r\n\r\nGrowth Hacking Funnel\r\n\r\nThe growth hacking funnel for startup marketing comprises of 5 stages based on the AARRR model.\r\n\r\nImage Source: Referral Saasquatch\r\n\r\nAcquisition: For startup or a small business, this stage is where you gain the necessary awareness among your target audience to see results from your marketing efforts. Activation: Now that your audience knows about your business and the services\/products you have to offer, it\u2019s time to convert them into customers. This stage helps you take your audience closer to the \u2018customer\u2019 stage. Retention: The market is where you meet your competitors. However, there\u2019s must be something that gives you an edge over others. This is the stage where you tap into your USP to convince your customer to keep using your product or service instead of multiple options available in the market. Referral: It wouldn\u2019t be wrong to say that \u2018word of mouth\u2019 marketing is the best form of marketing out there. This is the stage that deals with getting more customers out of your existing set of customers. Revenue: This is the end result achieved after optimised execution of all the above steps. Here you need to understand how your business will maintain a healthy cash flow with rising profit margin.\r\n\r\nNow that we have a basic understanding of the startup marketing funnel, let\u2019s dive into some these stages with examples from popular startups.\r\n\r\n1. Acquisition: How Airbnb generates the right awareness for their product\r\n\r\nThe founders of Airbnb, Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia, had just raised some initial funds for their business. However soon they started brainstorming better ways to scale their business rather than the current way of paid acquisition.\r\n\r\nThey began by narrowing down their market research to one basic question.\r\n\r\nWhat are the digital channels where there target audience searches for something more than just a standard hotel experience?\r\n\r\nCraigslist was the answer.\r\n\r\nThe next thing that Airbnb had under their radar was to get their listings on Craigslist too. This would help them get more traction for their own listings.\r\n\r\nThe results?\r\n\r\nUsing this hack, Airbnb managed to pull in thousands of users from Craigslist. Moreover, since their listings were much more comprehensive aided with better descriptions and photographs than Craigslist, the idea led to a viral growth cycle.\r\n\r\nImage Source: Growth Hackers\r\n\r\n2. Activation: How to activate users, the \u2018PayPal style\u2019\r\n\r\nPayPal grew to 5 million users in summer 2000 from 1 million users in March 2000. This is one of the reasons why it is one of the most growth-oriented startup of the late 1990s.\r\n\r\nThe first step they took to trigger growth is activate users by paying them to sign up. With every sign up, you were credited $20 (apart from $20 for a referral). Over a period of time as the number of signups boomed exponentially, they reduced the bonus offered, eventually fropping down to nothing.\r\n\r\nThis way PayPal makes a classic example of activating users by awarding them adaptive incentives. While the company did invest in varied advertising practises, the above method was the best hack to achieve lowest CAC.\r\n\r\nImage Source: Quora\r\n\r\n3. Retention: How Groove pulled down their churn rate by 71%\r\n\r\nOne of the major obstacles every SaaS company faces is high churn rates. Churn rate is nothing but the percentage of people exiting out of your subscription based business.\r\n\r\nGroove was one of them. Groove is an easy to use help desk software for businesses coming at $15 per user.\r\n\r\nAlthough the company had a healthy flow of new users, Groove\u2019s 4.5% churn rate was gradually turning the business model on an unsustainable path.\r\n\r\nSo the folks at Groove analyzed users who stayed on-board for more than 30 days and the ones who quit before that. They divided people in the following categories:\r\n\r\nAT the end of a lot of brainstorming, Groove made up its mind to send targeted emails to people who spent less time on the platform or\/and were likely to opt out after 30 days period.\r\n\r\nPeople who were spending less than 2 minutes on the site in one session were sent this message:\r\n\r\nImage Source: Kissmetrics\r\n\r\nFor someone who checked in fewer than 2 times in the first 10 days was sent the following message:\r\n\r\nImage Source: Kissmetrics\r\n\r\nThe results?\r\n\r\nThis conversion optimization strategy, helped Groove reduce their churn rate by as much as 71%.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the point where your users struggle while using your product\/service and addressing the same could just save the day for you.\r\n\r\n4. Referral: Dropbox fueled their growth by tapping into referral marketing\r\n\r\nThe success mantra for Dropbox to be one of the most popular tech startups is tapping into the power of referral marketing.\r\n\r\nWith a paid marketing campaign under progress, Dropbox spent $250 per customer for a product that was priced at $99.\r\n\r\nEvery friend you referred Dropbox to, was in turn credited with 500 MB additional storage. You got to earn up to 16GB of free space using this hack.\r\n\r\nImage Source : Referral Candy\r\n\r\nThe next thing they gave attention to was making sure the referral process was as smooth as possible.\r\n\r\nImage Source: Referral Candy\r\n\r\nThe key takeaway here is that \u2018word of mouth\u2019 marketing is a powerful hack to pull in more users\/traffic on-board. Incorporating referral signups\/purchases in your business model with complementary incentives for customers can trigger growth.\r\n\r\n5. Revenue: The growth engine of PicMonkey\r\n\r\nPicMonkey is a company in the photo editing space. But their share of growth hack involves building a great product with a freemium model.\r\n\r\nWhile millions of users were joining in, every month they were editing billions of photos using PicMonkey. While they could access basic filters for free, advanced filters and tools were available for a monthly fee of $4.99.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, hundreds of thousands of users pay that subscription price.\r\n\r\nImage Source: Fortune\r\n\r\nThe company has been riding the tide of increasing profits ever since, with the exact growth being 40% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe major takeaway here is that going freemium could be the ultimate growth hack for your business. Offering a part of your service as free is a way of educating them how good your product is and in turn assuring them of the value they\u2019ll get once they purchase the premium product\/service.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, growth hacking isn\u2019t just about SEO or social media marketing. It comprises of an optimised mix of digital marketing strategies and tools that can pull in significant traction for your business in a cost-effective way.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\n\r\nShivankit Arora is a growth hacker and the founder of a startup marketing agency, MarketingMasala.com.

Because so many aspiring founders, unfortunately, believe that launching a company is easy and is an effective means to gain money and fame, Adeo, along with those of the rest of us at the Founder Institute, have set out to prove that only the most passionate, dedicated, and resourceful will have what it takes to survive in the startup world.\r\n\r\nAdeo recently wrote an article about the topic of commitment in the Forbes article, \"A Business Is Not Worth Building Unless You Are Ready To 'Go All In'\". Below are some of the key points.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve started 9 businesses and have invested all of my time, all of my network, and most of my money into each and every one of them. Most have done well and others have failed, but I wouldn\u2019t advise an entrepreneur trying to build an impactful company to pursue any other strategy.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s why:\r\n\r\n1. Building an Impactful Company Requires 100% of Your Time\r\n\r\nI am always surprised by how many founders tell me things like \u201cI can\u2019t quit my job to build this business until I get some funding.\u201d This line of thinking of completely backwards, and naive. What investor in their right mind would take the risk of investing in your company if you (the founder) won\u2019t even take on the risk of future earnings to devote your time to it? Realistically, the founders that tell me this are hundreds of steps away from getting investment \u2013 but even then, do they really expect talented people to go out on a limb to join their team full-time if they\u2019re not willing to do the same? Unless you have an amazing track record in entrepreneurship, this is non-negotiable.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I am not saying that a business can\u2019t begin as a \u201cside-project\u201d. On the contrary, I believe starting a \u201cside-project\u201d before fully committing is the absolute best way to start a company. When it is just a \u201cproject\u201d (not a \u201cbusiness\u201d), you aren\u2019t too attached to it, and you can look at things objectively while testing the idea with customers, researching the economics, and getting feedback from experts.\r\n\r\nHowever, once you have put in several months (at least) and have gotten the proper validation, you need to devote 100% of your time to build the business if you want to have any chance of success. Realistically, this means 60+ hours per week for several years.\r\n\r\n2. Building an Impactful Company Requires 100% of Your Network\r\n\r\nIf you are trying to build something of impact, then you need to quickly get comfortable with asking your friends, family, and colleagues for favors. These favors include, but are not limited to, sharing your news, giving you feedback on your product, providing introductions, handing over money (buying your product\/ investing in your company), and more.\r\n\r\nAs awkward as this may seem, there is really no getting around it. As an early-stage entrepreneur you usually have no tangible product to sell, so all you can sell is a vision or idea. This is actually very similar to a politician starting a \u201cmovement\u201d \u2013 and a \u201cmovement\u201d requires an initial audience to get it going.\r\n\r\nTo force this thinking on early-stage entrepreneurs that are not quite ready to go \u201call-in\u201d, in the first week of the Founder Institute we mandate that our founders create a mailing list of at least 20 friends, family members, and associates. After sending an initial introductory email where people can silently opt-out, the founders then send this mailing list business updates and requests for feedback on a weekly basis. To push things further, we even require our founders to add people to the list every week, and when they finish our program they have over 125 subscribed contacts that they know personally or met in the program.\r\n\r\nIs this overkill? To be honest, when we first implemented this strategy the required subscriber numbers were much lower. However, over time we have moved the requirements higher and higher because it has be so effective. At the end of the day, this simple mailing list has acted as a forcing function that not only gets our founders comfortable with selling to personal acquaintances, but also provides them with a wide net of people from which to get valuable feedback, spread news, and more.\r\n\r\nIf you are not comfortable asking friends, family and colleagues for favors related to your business, then I suggest you do something similar. Trying to build your company alone is usually a fool\u2019s errand.\r\n\r\n3. Building an Impactful Company Might Require All of Your Own Money\r\n\r\nIt does not always require 100% of your money, like numbers 1 and 2 above\u2026 but it might.\r\n\r\nThis is what startup people call \u201cskin in the game\u201d. Joining, investing in, or partnering with a startup is always a question of risk management, and the most remedial question someone can ask to mitigate risk before working with you is \u201cAre you committed?\u201d.\r\n\r\nThere is a difference between interest and commitment. When you\u2019re interested in something, you do it only when it\u2019s convenient. When you\u2019re committed to something, you accept no excuses, only results.\u201d \u2013 Kenneth H. Blanchard (Author of The One Minute Manager)\r\n\r\nMost of the successful entrepreneurs you read about today have invested most of their money into their businesses at the early stage, while also taking either a very low or the legal minimum salary for the first several years. I have done the same with all nine of my businesses.\r\n\r\nObviously not everyone has the luxury to do this, but at the very least, they should expect to front the initial costs of the business (incorporation, legal, basic technology\/materials, and the like), while also offering much higher salaries to their first key hires than their own. After all \u2013 what signifies more commitment from the founder than cold hard cash?\r\n\r\nOkay, so let\u2019s say you have read my three points above but are still wavering and not quite ready to go \u201call-in\u201d with your time, network, or money. What should you do?\r\n\r\nAt the very least, I recommend that you take a step back and ask yourself two key questions:\r\n\r\nAm I fully committed to this idea?\r\n\r\nIf you are ready to go all-in but do not believe you have validated your idea, you can usually find the answer by (1) isolating your area of concern, (2) getting feedback on it through a well-constructed \u201cMVP Test\u201d with a few hundred more potential customers, and (3) reviewing the results with someone that successfully built a business targeting the same customer. If you are not sold after that, then it\u2019s time to significantly alter (\u201cpivot\u201d) your idea, or start over altogether. Keep in mind that this is not a bad thing \u2013 it is better you learn this sooner rather than later.\r\n\r\nAm I ready for the rigors of starting a business?\r\n\r\nIf you believe you have validated your idea but are still not ready to go all-in, then work backwards and create a plan that will get you to that point. Maybe you have a child on the way, or other family obligations on the horizon? Maybe you need to save up money and start another \u201cside-hustle\u201d in the interim? Or, maybe you need to take time creating relationships that will be crucial for your business to succeed? Whatever the situation, just create an actionable plan to get you there as quickly as possible. I promise you that the longer you wait, the more your chances of getting started and succeeding diminish.\r\n\r\n(Business woman looking at road that goes up in the sky concept image by Shutterstock)","title":"Don\u2019t Build a Business Unless You\u2019re Ready to Give Your All","url":"http:\/\/FI.co\/posts\/28951","labels":["business fundamentals","marketing"]},{"body":"","title":"Engineering as Marketing-Traction Channel #10","url":"https:\/\/startuprunner.com\/engineering-marketing-traction-channel-10\/","labels":["business fundamentals"]},{"body":"","title":"The Core Tenets of Jobs-to-be-Done Theory","url":"https:\/\/jobs-to-be-done.com\/the-5-tenets-of-jobs-to-be-done-theory-ba58c3a093c1","labels":[]},{"body":"Finding the right investors is like dating \u2014 you need to kiss many frogs before you find a prince.\r\n\r\nToday, I\u2019m going to share seven ways fundraising founders can kiss fewer frogs and find more princes (subtle hint: Batch 19 applications are now open).\r\n\r\nHabit 1 \u2013 Pitch to the Right Investors\r\n\r\nNot all investors are created equal.\r\n\r\nSome investors only invest in seed investments. Some investors only focus on Series A.\r\n\r\nBefore approaching any investors, do your homework and make sure you go after the right target audience.\r\n\r\nYou can segment them with these 5 characteristics:\r\n\r\nInvestment stages (seed, Series A, B, C, etc.) Check size (e.g. $50,000 \u2013 $150,000) How many deals has he or she done in past 6 months (you will find out how active this investor is) Industry focus (if any) Geography (most Silicon Valley investors would not invest outside of the Bay Area)\r\n\r\nIt is certainly quite rare to turn someone who isn\u2019t already engaged in your industry or geography into someone who suddenly cares about what you\u2019ve created.\r\n\r\nHabit 2 \u2013 Pitch with Purpose\r\n\r\nMy colleague Andrea Barrica introduced me to this quote by Maya Angelou:\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat do you want your potential investors walk away with after your pitch?\r\n\r\nKeep that in mind and you very likely will change the story you tell and the way you tell it.\r\n\r\nHabit 3 \u2013 Curate Your Story\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s harder to tell a short than a long story.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s easy to tell your investors everything that\u2019s happened in your life since you were 3, but whittling that down to what they really need to know is much harder \u2014 and much more compelling.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t be lazy, or self-indulgent. Put in the extra 20% effort and curate only relevant and story that make you uniquely over qualify for your startup.\r\n\r\nHabit 4 \u2013 Pitch like a Professional\r\n\r\nDuring your pitch, you need to convey two things: 1) why you are the most qualified person and 2) why investors should give you money now.\r\n\r\nBe sure to cover the following if you are ready, but always start with traction & demo if you have it.\r\n\r\nHere are 11 things to cover:\r\n\r\nTraction, traction, traction Revenue User download User engagement Major signed partnerships Product demo (If you have it. You should have it.) Market size & target market Pain point Product Team (team, investors, advisors) Technology Business model Monetization model Competition Market Trends\r\n\r\nHabit 5 \u2013 Understand the Big Picture\r\n\r\nMost founders I met are in love with their product.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as an investor, I don\u2019t just want a person who is in love with himself or herself or their product.\r\n\r\nI want a founder who truly understands how to create a business. You should be the one who can tell me everything about your competitors, market, legal environment or policy changes.\r\n\r\nHabit 6 \u2013 24 Hour Follow Up\r\n\r\nAfter your first call or in person meeting, be sure to follow up within 24 hours and make sure to cover the following in your follow up email:\r\n\r\nThank them!\r\n\r\nYour deck\r\n\r\nCurrent traction\r\n\r\nTeam\r\n\r\nAction items\r\n\r\nYour ask\r\n\r\nAsk for follow up meetings or phone calls\r\n\r\nHabit 7 \u2013 Show Passion & Honesty\r\n\r\nBuilding a startup is really, really hard work.\r\n\r\nAs an investor, I want to find someone who won\u2019t back down when things get (even) harder, and is willing to do whatever it takes to make things happen.\r\n\r\nA huge part of working hard \u2014 and knowing where to work harder \u2014 is knowing what isn\u2019t working (yet).\r\n\r\nShow your true self, and be honest. It\u2019s ok to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d You don\u2019t need to have all the answers, but you do need to have the strength of character and work ethic to figure it out.","title":"The 7 (Pitching) Habits of Highly Effective Founders","url":"http:\/\/500.co\/7-pitching-habits-for-founders","labels":[]},{"body":"","title":"The Behavioural Roadmap for Startups","url":"http:\/\/seedcamp.com\/resources\/the-behavioural-roadmap-for-startups\/","labels":["startup fundamentals"]},{"body":"","title":"Five Smart Exit Strategies","url":"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/startup-exits-should-be-positive-and-planned-early-2011-1","labels":["agile principles","interpersonal skills"]},{"body":"When Asana was a young company of just a few people, we experienced a phenomenon that\u2019s common with early-stage startups.

At Asana, we consider the planning process to be just as critical as the execution process. You wouldn\u2019t run a race without a route. Similarly, it\u2019s difficult to run an organization without mapping out clear goals.\r\n\r\nSketching out a roadmap\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to do planning. After years of prototyping our own systems, we\u2019ve landed on a model that works well for us, and that may work well for you too. We structure our calendar into ~4-month periods we call \u201cepisodes.\u201d During each episode, we stick to our plans. As new ideas come up, we write them down and table them for later.\r\n\r\nIn between each episode, we hold a weeklong event called Roadmap Week. Roadmap Week is when we reflect, integrate new ideas, and plan just how we\u2019ll carry them out. The whole company comes together for both high-level reflection on how the last episode went, and high-level planning on how the next episode should go. It\u2019s a time to dream big and review all those ideas we wrote down over the past few months. Large strategic pivots are now on the table.\r\n\r\nThe week is driven forward by committees that facilitate a series of meetings focusing on everything from deployment and scalability to metrics and design. We take an honest look back on our successes and failures, discuss our goals and deliverables, map out the next episode\u2019s key milestones, and envision new ways to experiment. Because we consolidate many meetings into that week, we have fewer meetings throughout the rest of the year.\r\n\r\nSometimes people say, \u201cI don\u2019t have time to do these kinds of planning exercises.\u201d We\u2019ve found that we don\u2019t have time not to do these exercises. Without a clear plan, you might find yourself running a race without a route\u2014perhaps quickly, but in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\nUltimately, organizations exist to accomplish goals. Succeeding at those goals comes down to being clear about exactly what you\u2019re trying to accomplish (\u201cclarity of purpose\u201d) and how you\u2019re going to get there (\u201cclarity of plan\u201d).\r\n\r\nHere are some of the major ways we\u2019ve benefited from implementing Roadmap Weeks.\r\n\r\nLearn from your failures.\r\n\r\nWe look carefully at our ideas and goals set forth during our previous Roadmap Week, and inevitably, many of them won\u2019t have come to fruition. That\u2019s okay: You can often learn more from failures than successes. Deconstructing where, and why, something went wrong gives you the chance to both identify warning signs and avoid similar courses of action in the future.\r\n\r\nBut also from your successes.\r\n\r\nOf course, it\u2019s just as important to recognize and celebrate our achievements so we can replicate them elsewhere. Looking at how ideas were implemented successfully means we can use similar approaches that will lead to more successes.\r\n\r\nLean into big, bold ideas.\r\n\r\nRoadmap Week is our chance to look at all of the big ideas that came up during an episode, and evaluate them objectively. In the course of an episode, I personally will generate five new big directions we could take the product; they all look great when they\u2019re shiny and new, but by the time Roadmap Week rolls around, only one of them will seem actually worth pursuing. Once we identify the ideas that have staying power, we sketch out a realistic work plan, and put individual next steps in Asana.\r\n\r\nCollaborate with teams that otherwise wouldn\u2019t work together.\r\n\r\nRoadmap Week is an opportunity to bring together individuals from teams that don\u2019t normally interact day-to-day. It\u2019s a chance to hear from people from different parts of the company, who might have ideas about areas they don\u2019t normally work on. For example, often a product team will present an idea for a feature, and someone from our customer success team will be able to correct their assumptions about what customers actually want from the feature.\r\n\r\nAnticipate problems.\r\n\r\nIn mapping out how to execute a goal, it\u2019s worth brainstorming all the potential roadblocks that could impede you. These obstacles can often be gleaned from past failures. Other times, they\u2019re determined by vividly imagining just how certain scenarios will play out. \u201cPre-morteming\u201d is surprisingly effective: Pretend it\u2019s four months from now, and the project has failed; what went wrong?\r\n\r\nCapitalize on collective energy.\r\n\r\nRoadmap Week is not only a reset; it\u2019s a time for teammates to come together, celebrate all you\u2019ve accomplished, and enjoy the freedom of open-ended creative exploration. Ideas produce inspiration, and inspiration produces dopamine ;-). It\u2019s a pleasure to harness the collective passion and excitement that comes out of dreaming big, together.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re interested in building a framework to create your own Roadmap Week, read our guide to forming successful committees that host productive planning meetings.","title":"How Roadmap Week helps us turn big ideas into reality","url":"https:\/\/wavelength.asana.com\/work-plans-high-level-objectives-roadmap-week\/#close","labels":["agile principles"]},{"body":"","title":"4 Diverse Work Styles and 3 Ways to Manage Them","url":"https:\/\/www.tlnt.com\/4-diverse-work-styles-and-3-ways-to-manage-them\/","labels":["branding","marketing","people management","product management"]},{"body":"","title":"Sprint: Monday","url":"https:\/\/library.gv.com\/sprint-week-monday-4bf0606b5c81","labels":[]},{"body":"","title":"9 Qualities to Look for in a High-Performing Business Development Professional","url":"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/agency\/9-qualities-every-business-development-professional-should-have","labels":["business fundamentals","company growth","interpersonal skills","marketing","people management"]},{"body":"","title":"Storytelling as a Business Communication Skill","url":"http:\/\/playbook.amanet.org\/storytelling-business-communication-skill\/","labels":["business fundamentals","interpersonal skills","marketing"]},{"body":"","title":"Kanban vs. Scrum: Which Is Better?","url":"https:\/\/www.projectmanager.com\/blog\/kanban-vs-scrum-better","labels":[]},{"body":"","title":"How to Define and Build a Great Organizational Culture in 2018","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/the-mission\/how-to-define-and-build-a-great-organizational-culture-in-2018-f8b972e433b6","labels":["company culture","interpersonal skills"]},{"body":"How Netflix does A\/B Testing\r\n\r\nHave you ever wondered why Netflix has such a great streaming experience? Do you want to learn how they completed their homepage plus other UI layout redesigns through A\/B testing? If so, then this article is for you!\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll start with sharing my takeaways from a Designers+Geeks event I attended last week at Yelp. The two great speakers Anna Blaylock and Navin Iyengar, both product designers at Netflix, walked through insights gleaned from their years of A\/B testing on tens of millions of Netflix members, and showed some relevant examples from the product to help attendees think about their own designs.\r\n\r\nPhoto from the presentation\r\n\r\nExperimentation\r\n\r\nI really liked this first slide of the presentation and think it\u2019s smart to use an image from the TV show \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d to explain the concept of experimentation!\r\n\r\nPhoto from the presentation\r\n\r\nThe Scientific Method\r\n\r\nPhoto from the presentation\r\n\r\nHypothesis\r\n\r\nIn science, a hypothesis is an idea or explanation that you then test through study and experimentation. In design, a theory or guess can also be called a hypothesis.\r\n\r\nPhoto from the presentation\r\n\r\nThe basic idea of a hypothesis is that there is no pre-determined outcome. It is something that can be tested and that those tests can be replicated.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe general concept behind A\/B testing is to create an experiment with a control group and one or more experimental groups (called \u201ccells\u201d within Netflix) which receive alternative treatments. Each member belongs exclusively to one cell within a given experiment, with one of the cells always designated the \u201cdefault cell\u201d. This cell represents the control group, which receives the same experience as all Netflix members not in the test.\u201d \u2014 Netflix blog\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s how A\/B testing is done at Netflix: as soon as the test is live, they track specific metrics of importance. For example, it could be elements like streaming hours and retention. Once the participants have provided enough meaningful conclusions, they move onto the efficacy of each test and define a winner out of the different variations.\r\n\r\nImage from the presentation\r\n\r\nPhoto from the presentation that shows the hypothesis process\r\n\r\nExperiment\r\n\r\nExperimentation is the act of experimenting. Many companies like Netflix run experiments to generate user data. It is also important to take time and effort to organize the experiment properly to ensure that both the type and amount of data is sufficient and available to clarify the questions of interest as efficiently as possible.\r\n\r\nYou probably have noticed that the featured show on the Netflix homepage seems to change whenever you log in. They\u2019re all part of Netflix\u2019s complex experiments to get you to watch their shows.\r\n\r\nHomepage when I logged in the 1st time\r\n\r\nImage from the presentation: the House of Cards page when seen as a signed-out user\r\n\r\nHome page when I logged in the 2nd time\r\n\r\nHome page when I switch the account user name\r\n\r\nHome page when I switch name to kids\r\n\r\nHome page when I\u2019m not signed in\r\n\r\nThe idea of A\/B testing is to present different content to different user groups, gather their reactions and use the results to build strategies in the future. According to this blog post written by Netflix engineer Gopal Krishnan:\r\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t capture a member\u2019s attention within 90 seconds, that member will likely lose interest and move onto another activity. Such failed sessions could at times be because we did not show the right content or because we did show the right content but did not provide sufficient evidence as to why our member should watch it.\r\n\r\nNetflix did an experiment back in 2013 to see if they can create a few artwork variants that increase the audience for a title. Here is the result:\r\n\r\nImage from Netflix blog\r\n\r\nIt was an early signal that members are sensitive to artwork changes. It was also a signal that there were better ways they could help Netflix members find the types of stories they were looking for within the Netflix experience.\r\n\r\nNetflix later created a system that automatically grouped artwork that had different aspect ratios, crops, touch ups, localized title treatments but had the same background image. They replicated experiment on their other TV shows to track relative artwork performance. Here are some examples:\r\n\r\nImage from Netflix blog, the two marked images significantly outperformed all others.\r\n\r\nImage from Netflix blog, the last marked images significantly outperformed all others.\r\n\r\nCheck out these two blog posts to learn more about Netflix A\/B testing:\r\n\r\nHow Netflix selects the best artwork for videos through A\/B testing\r\n\r\nThe Netflix experimentation platform, a service which makes it possible for every Netflix engineering team to implement their A\/B tests with the support of a specialized engineering team.\r\n\r\nWhat I learned\r\n\r\nA\/B testing is the most reliable way to learn user behaviors. As designers, we should think about our work through the lens of experimentation.\r\n\r\nImage from the presentation: your instinct is not always right\r\n\r\nWhen and why A\/B testing\r\n\r\nOnce you have a design in production, use A\/B testing to tweak the design and target two key metrics: retention and revenue. By A\/B testing changes throughout the product and tracking users over time, you can see whether your change improves retention or increases revenue. If it does, make it the default. In this way A\/B testing can be used to continuously improve business metrics. Are your users finding or doing one thing you want them to find or to do?\r\n\r\nMy experience is that often times users cannot always complete a task as fast as you expect, and sometimes they can\u2019t even find a certain button you put on a page. The reasons can vary: it might because the design is not intuitive enough; the color is not vibrant enough; the user is not tech savvy; they don\u2019t know how to make a decision because there are too many options on one page, and so on. Are your intuitions correct?\r\n\r\nSadly, when it comes to user behavior, our intuitions could be wrong, and the only way to prove it is through A\/B testing. It is the best way to validate whether one UX design is more effective than another. At work, our consumer product team have proved that through A\/B testing on our real estate website. For example, they wanted to figure out whether they can make a design change to improve the registration rate for users who clicked on a Google Ad. They created a few different experimental designs and tested them. They thought the design that only hides the property image would win, but found that the design that hides both the property image and the price got the highest conversation rate. Explore the boundaries\r\n\r\nThe best ideas come from many idea explorations. At work, our product team works collaboratively across many different projects. With so many parties involved (from designers to product managers to developers), we get to explore the boundaries together. Some of the best ideas are sometime from the developers or the product managers after testing out our prototypes. Observe what people do, not what they say\r\n\r\nWhen talking to users, it\u2019s important to keep this in mind: they always say one thing but do it differently. I conducted a few user testing sessions this week and have one perfect example to show you why. I had this one user testing out a Contacts list view prototype and asked him if he usually sorts\/filters his Contacts. He said no because he wouldn\u2019t need do so. However, when he discovered the new filters dropdown menu, he was amazed by how convenient it is to sort and filter multiple options at a time and immediately asked when that can roll out in production. Use data to estimate size of opportunity\r\n\r\n\u2022 It\u2019s always about the whys\r\n\r\n\u2022 Data can help shape ideas\r\n\r\n\u2022 Check if any A\/B testing are in conflict\r\n\r\nIsn\u2019t it so fun to be a UI and UX designer? :) Knowing your user is the most exciting part of design process! There is no finished design, but many chances for iteration to improve the design and give our users the best experience possible! I enjoy the opportunity to make subtle tweaks for our users, measure their reactions and work with the product team to figure out the next steps.\r\n\r\nIf you like this article, please kindly tap the \u2764 button below! :)","title":"How Netflix does A\/B Testing","url":"https:\/\/uxdesign.cc\/how-netflix-does-a-b-testing-87df9f9bf57c","labels":["product discovery"]},{"body":"","title":"How to Deal With Industry Competition","url":"https:\/\/www.liveplan.com\/blog\/2016\/12\/how-to-deal-with-industry-competition\/","labels":["business fundamentals","company culture","company growth","product growth"]},{"body":"","title":"The 10 Most Popular Startup Revenue Models","url":"https:\/\/fi.co\/insight\/the-10-most-popular-startup-revenue-models","labels":["sales","startup fundamentals"]},{"body":"","title":"What is Market Research?","url":"https:\/\/www.oberlo.co.uk\/ecommerce-wiki\/market-research","labels":["branding","business fundamentals","marketing","product management","sales"]},{"body":"","title":"THE 7 HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE STRATEGIC ACCOUNT MANAGERS","url":"https:\/\/yesler.com\/blog\/customer-engagement\/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-strategic-account-managers","labels":["marketing","product management"]},{"body":"","title":"The Role of a Product Manager","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/swlh\/the-role-of-a-product-manager-e0354b4b6845","labels":["product management"]},{"body":"One Cow Describes Eight Business Models\r\n\r\nWritten by Jennifer Gueringer \/\/ Also shared on Startups.co.\r\n\r\nBusiness theory can be tricky to understand.

This takes a deep commitment to understanding yourself \u2014 how you think, how you act, your strengths, your blind spots, and your leadership gaps. It also takes a deep commitment to working on yourself.\r\n\r\nThe more you invest in your own leadership skills (yes, it\u2019s an investment) \u2014 the better you will be at inspiring your people, creating and seizing opportunities, and handling problems and challenges.\r\n\r\nHere are a few things you can do to push yourself towards self-mastery and leadership excellence:\r\n\r\n1. Implement a leadership development plan. Via self-reflection, asking for feedback and\/or 360 degree reviews, determine what behaviors or skills you want to improve and then create (and stick to) a plan to do so.\r\n\r\n2. Practice self-care. It is your job to optimize yourself for peak performance and to bring a healthy, creative, and productive YOU to work each day. Building a sustainable life for yourself and your employees is crucial to building a sustainable business.\r\n\r\n3. Hire a coach. Growing yourself into the best leader you can be while also growing your company is hard. Having an accountability and thought partner is a wise investment.\r\n\r\nThe second, sustainable competitive advantage you can create is a strong, positive company culture. Not to beat a dead horse here, but it all begins with you, first and foremost. Leading a company is akin to being a parent \u2014 i.e. the kids are watching, and most likely mirroring, everything you do.\r\n\r\nEven when you think no one is paying attention, they are. They are watching what you do to signal what is acceptable behavior \u2014 how they should act and interact, if they should burn the midnight oil, if they should treat Mondays like good days, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are many things that go into creating a strong company culture. Here are just a few things you can do to shape and sustain a culture that helps your employees and business to thrive:\r\n\r\n1. Be thoughtful about your company\u2019s core values. No copying and pasting from the websites of the companies you admire most! Have explanations for, and discussions around, what each value means, and then \u201cWalk the Talk\u201d as the leader.\r\n\r\n2. Stay consciously focused on maintaining a foundation of trust. Lead from an authentic place and your team will follow. Trust in the A-team you hired and they will, in turn, trust you and each other.\r\n\r\n3. Promote a culture of learning. Practice and preach growth mindset and develop a feedback-seeking culture by asking for feedback as much as you give it.","title":"YOUR BIGGEST COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES: YOURSELF AND YOUR COMPANY CULTURE","url":"https:\/\/startupsventurecapital.com\/there-are-really-only-two-substantial-and-sustainable-competitive-advantages-that-are-within-your-d0625c0fbc28","labels":["company culture"]},{"body":"","title":"IS AFFILIATE MARKETING RIGHT FOR YOUR STARTUP?","url":"http:\/\/www.nextupasia.com\/is-affiliate-marketing-for-startups\/","labels":["branding","business fundamentals","marketing","product management","sales","startup fundamentals"]},{"body":"","title":"11 Remarkably Effective Ways to Lead by Example","url":"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/peter-economy\/11-surprisingly-effective-ways-to-lead-by-example.html","labels":[]},{"body":"","title":"The 2-Step Facebook Lead Gen Funnel For Local Businesses","url":"https:\/\/www.crazyeyemarketing.com\/blog\/the-2-step-facebook-lead-gen-funnel-for-local-businesses\/","labels":["business fundamentals","marketing"]},{"body":"","title":"When Is It Time to Scale Your Business?","url":"http:\/\/www.coxblue.com\/when-is-it-time-to-scale-your-business\/","labels":["business fundamentals","marketing"]},{"body":"","title":"7 Steps for More Effective A\/B Testing","url":"https:\/\/www.usertesting.com\/blog\/2015\/08\/20\/7-steps-for-more-effective-ab-testing\/","labels":["product discovery"]},{"body":"","title":"The Importance of Market Research to Your Business","url":"https:\/\/www.thebalance.com\/why-marketing-research-is-important-to-your-business-2296119","labels":["business fundamentals","marketing","sales"]},{"body":"","title":"5 Steps to Executing the Perfect Sales Prospecting Campaign [+ Templates]","url":"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/sales\/perfect-outbound-sales-plan","labels":["marketing","sales"]},{"body":"","title":" Inexpensive Ways to Conduct Marketing Research","url":"http:\/\/buzz.greatfxprinting.com\/inexpensive-market-research.htm","labels":["branding","business fundamentals","marketing","product management","sales"]},{"body":"The Five Types of Virality\r\n\r\nand choosing the right one for your product to grow\r\n\r\nEvery entrepreneur has the dream of making their startup\u2019s product go viral. But too often this is couched in a na\u00efve understanding of virality. \u201cLet\u2019s make our app viral!\u201d Or your investors ask you, \u201cCan you take your app and add a little bit more virality?\u201d (I often hear this described as growth hacking, too.)\r\n\r\nSometimes it feels like people believe virality is just magic pixie dust that can be sprinkled on anything. Fortunately, it\u2019s much more concrete than that. But to understand how virality works, you first have to know that not all virality is the same. Many successful companies have done distinct things to help make their products go viral, all in completely different ways. So I thought it would be helpful to try to classify the disparate approaches.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re trying to build your company and grow your product, it helps to think as specifically as possible about how to get your product in front of people. You can engineer features that will amplify the chances that people will want to try it. Of course first, you have to make a great product that people love. Once they love it, they\u2019ll talk about it more. But how do you actually feed them the language to talk about it and enhance that word of mouth experience? How do you remind them to talk about it when they\u2019re having a great experience? Or later? You need to understand what\u2019s inside your core users\u2019 minds, and use that knowledge to help them share your product through whatever means makes the most sense.\r\n\r\nDo you need to build incentive programs into your product and marketing plans? Or, if people are making something tangible and shareable with your product, like pictures, how do you get them to share it in a way that other people will be naturally exposed to the product? And then how do you make sure that the flow of interested people actually converts to new users as seamlessly as possible?\r\n\r\nThe most basic element common to all these different types virality is inception. The goal of all viral efforts is to insert (or \u201cincept\u201d) an idea of what a product can do into someone else\u2019s head, and to get them so excited about it they want to try it and use it. That\u2019s the most important component of any type of virality. What is that little sentence, that little hook, that little reason why somebody actually wants to try your product out?\r\n\r\nSo here\u2019s what I\u2019ve found are the five main types ways a product can do this. Do you have another way I didn\u2019t cover here? I\u2019d love to hear about it.\r\n\r\nWord-of-mouth virality\r\n\r\nThis one is straightforward: It\u2019s simply a product being so good that people can\u2019t help telling their friends about it. For example, when Google was just taking off, people would notice you searching on Alta Vista or Infoseek or another search engine and they\u2019d tell you \u201cuse Google, the search is so much better.\u201d So the next time you did a search, you\u2019d try it, and pretty soon you\u2019d be telling others about it too.\r\n\r\nA couple of years ago, when we got our first iPhone apps, geeks like me were telling everyone they knew about Evernote, because it lets you sync notes between your computer and your smartphone. It often happened when you\u2019d see someone taking notes on their phone, and they\u2019d tell you they were using Evernote and how simple it was to keep one copy of the notes everywhere.\r\n\r\nOne other key to word of mouth virality is making sure your product is easy to find later. Having a name that is easy to remember, *and to spell* certainly helps (Google is easier than Googol \u2014 the number it was named after). Missing vowels and doubled letters, not having the right domain name or app store name always make it trickier. One test I like to do when trying out new company names is check the typeahead in the App Store. If you are calling your application InstaGreatCoolThing, you might realize users typing ahead will see Instagram and similar apps before yours (until you are as big as Instagram).\r\n\r\nThe other key is to make sure your product is easy to describe. The words you use to describe your product \u2014 on your home page, in your press messaging, and in the product itself will be the foundation of how your users describe it. This is really important because it\u2019s how your users will incept other users with what your product does. Funny side features like Google\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m feeling lucky\u201d or Facebook\u2019s \u201cPoke\u201d often help to make the description memorable too. If you don\u2019t have a pithy way to describe your product, you should assume your users won\u2019t be able to either.\r\n\r\nIncentivized word-of-mouth virality\r\n\r\nThis is similar to word-of-mouth, but with a little added incentive for people to refer their friends. For instance, 15 years ago, Paypal would give you $10 if you referred a friend and they created an account. Similarly, Dropbox and Uber have used incentives to great effect. Refer a friend and they\u2019ll get more free storage (and you too), or a discount on their first ride.\r\n\r\nIt helps when the incentive works both ways, as a coupon for the new users as well as an reward for the referring user when the recipient creates a new account. Because you are paying for it and discounting your service, it\u2019s not quite as clean or pure as word-of-mouth, but it can be very effective.\r\n\r\nDemonstration virality\r\n\r\nDemonstration virality is when the nature of a product is such that, simply by using it, people are showing it off. One great example is Instagram: In 2010 it was fairly difficult to get photos off your phone and into some useful place, so Instagram added tools for people to easily share their photos out to Twitter, Facebook, and Flickr. Instagram\u2019s filters naturally caught people\u2019s attention on those networks. It provoked an instant \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d reaction.\r\n\r\nYou can see Prisma blowing up this summer in the same way. You can create these incredible, stained-glass-like artworks with it, and then share them on Instagram or wherever. Of course people want to know how did you did that, so they\u2019ll ask you \u2014 or they can see the little Prisma logo on the image, and then go get the app themselves.\r\n\r\nMusical.ly spreads in a similar way as users and influencers create very cool music videos and then share them on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and people decide to try Musical.ly to make their own.\r\n\r\nAnother example is Pinterest. If I create a pinboard of fun GIFs or wedding ideas or recipes, and I share it, the act of sharing is a built-in advertisement for Pinterest\u2019s awesomeness.\r\n\r\nEven Uber benefited from demonstration virality early on. You\u2019d show up to a meeting in a black car and people would be like, \u201cDude, where did you get the limo?\u201d Or you\u2019d be leaving a party and you\u2019d just press the Uber button and a car showed up for you. Meanwhile, your friends were trying to hail cabs or call for rides. Just by using Uber, you were a walking advertisement for the product and how much better it was.\r\n\r\nInfectious virality\r\n\r\nInfectious virality is when a product is designed in a way that people will work to get other people using it because it will make it better for both of them. It\u2019s when one user is \u201cinfecting\u201d another with the virus, I mean the product so that they are both hooked. For example, Snapchat users have a big incentive to encourage their friends to download Snapchat so they can send photos back and forth in a more authentic and safe way. Twitter works the same way: If you follow me on Twitter I\u2019ll have more followers, and you can see what I\u2019m doing and tweeting, and it\u2019ll be great for both of us. Nextdoor is a really interesting example where even though people might not know their neighbors, they can send them postcards to invite them and make the neighborhood community larger and more productive for everyone. And of course LinkedIn and Facebook are the canonical examples of infectious virality where people invited you to be their colleagues or friends on the service.\r\n\r\nInvitations are the key to spreading infectious virality. However \u2014 false invitations or overly spammy invitations often have a deleterious effect on virality. When someone invites you to a service only because they invited their entire address book, it doesn\u2019t feel personal or connected. And if you sign up and the person doesn\u2019t even use the product, then the likelihood for the next person to become active diminishes greatly.\r\n\r\nThis is what most people think of as classic virality, because it\u2019s how we\u2019ve seen social networks and communication networks spread. And who doesn\u2019t love the special feeling of being \u201cinvited\u201d to a product by their friend? But infectious virality doesn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t apply to all products. Being invited into a product that isn\u2019t naturally social doesn\u2019t really work. So use this method carefully and make sure it really applies to your product.\r\n\r\nOutbreak virality\r\n\r\nFinally, some things just spread because they\u2019re fun to share, or because they\u2019ve got a lot of popular momentum and people want to look cool by sharing them. YouTube videos blow up because they\u2019re funny, or addictive, and it\u2019s just fun to share them with your friends.\r\n\r\nIn a similar way, Pok\u00e9mon Go took off this summer in part because everyone was doing it, and it was just fun to tell your friends about it and to participate yourself. Of course, there are other aspects to this game\u2019s success, such as the fact that it was leveraging a very established, beloved brand, but it also benefited from this virtuous circle of fun, popularity, and sharing.\r\n\r\nPutting it all together\r\n\r\nWhen you understand the different tools and that they all work differently, you can design or build virality into your product in a way that\u2019s very natural.\r\n\r\nI often see founders saying something like, \u201cI\u2019m just going to add an invite flow to my product.\u201d That doesn\u2019t work in most cases. If it\u2019s not well positioned and well integrated, an invite flow is just going to produce a bunch of ineffective invites that won\u2019t convert into new users. It might just bring in a bunch of transient users who don\u2019t stick around. You don\u2019t want to try infectious virality unless it really is applicable \u2014 that you want each user to bring another user into the product experience so that it will be better for both of them. If your product is about creating content or having experiences that are easy to show off, it\u2019s often much better to focus on demonstration virality. And if your product costs money and has value, an incentivized word of mouth strategy can really pay off.\r\n\r\nWhen you successfully create that moment of inception, and get the idea of your product into someone\u2019s mind, you do need to follow that up with a smooth new-user flow. The person who shows up to your website or the App Store is ready to try it. They are excited to try it and give your product some attention. This is your best chance ever to get them to learn more about what the product does and get it set up for their value. You need to start the onboarding process right so the product has a chance to become a habit, and then for that user to spread it to the next set of people.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s entirely possible to have mass deception, where you find a good growth hack and get a bunch of people show up and try your product quickly. But if you\u2019ve enticed them for the wrong reason, they don\u2019t actually adopt the product, or if they do, they don\u2019t stick around long enough to feed the next round of viral adoption. So whenever you\u2019re thinking about engineering virality, you need to be sure that it\u2019s reaching the right people, gets them interested for reasons that align with the intrinsic value of your product, and leads them to the right actions.\r\n\r\nI still remember when I was first invited to Snapchat. A friend texted me to join them so we could send funny faces back and forth and they would be deleted. When I joined up, the first thing he did was send me a funny face and we ended up having a lot of fun with it. The viral hook connected directly with my first use. Over time we learned to send a lot more types of communication together and added more and more friends and it took off. But if Snapchat had offered free beer to everyone who signed up for Snapchat, they might have driven a lot of new users even faster, but those people would all be gone as soon as they finished the beer.\r\n\r\nRemember, at the end of the day, there\u2019s only one metric that really matters: How many people are actually using your product. Not downloading it, not clicking on it, not trying it for a day. Actually using it. So your viral techniques all need to be aligned toward the goal of increasing the number of actual users.","title":"The Five Types of Virality","url":"https:\/\/news.greylock.com\/the-five-types-of-virality-8ba42051928d?source=rss----f89b20443665---4","labels":[]},{"body":"The Evolution of a Product Manager \u2013 Josh McWilliam\r\n\r\nBY TREMIS SKEETE ON MAY 15, 2017\r\n\r\nJosh McWilliam is a co-founder and Vice President of Product at College Factual. Their mission is to help every student realize their full potential through the best fit education their money can buy. While their focus is on students with the College Factual brand, they also have other brands like Ed.ai (for advisors), Educate.ai (for colleges), and BRIGHT HUB (for teachers).\r\n\r\nIn Josh\u2019s Product Tank NYC presentation, he explains his evolution as a product manager. His roles over the last 15 years have started with engineering and architecture, and moved on from there to product management, and now he oversees product, but also data science, engineering, and UI\/UX teams. His current role is best identified as Chief Operating Officer.\r\n\r\nWhat is a Product Manager?\r\n\r\nJosh openly admits that he has struggled at times to truly define the role of product manager. In fact, many people, both outside and inside the product community also struggle with this reality. Knowing that the product manager role is dependent on one\u2019s career background and skills and the industry that one works (among other things), Josh has gone through many different ideas of what product managers should do.\r\n\r\nBuild More Product\r\n\r\nJosh first assumed that his primary responsibilities involved satisfying his stakeholders and releasing lots of features. The problem with that definition, however, was that he had no validation process in place, and his technical focus caused him to ignore things such as marketing. He found himself being angry with stakeholders for failing to validate product ideas, despite doing exactly what he was told. He then realized that while his stakeholders may ask for certain things, his responsibility is to know what will or will not succeed.\r\n\r\nBuild the Right Product the Right way\r\n\r\nNext, Josh began to think about his effectiveness as a product manager more often. He focused on the product-market fit and user testing. At first, things began to work very well. But after a while, he started to realize that product success leads to managing more products, until eventually you start to lose control and become a bottleneck. Deadline pressure leads to making shortcuts, and you find yourself going from being a leader or coach on the team, to being a dictator, which can create friction on a team. Josh learned from his experiences with this that he needed to become scalable.\r\n\r\nJosh discovered that once you start to focus on scalability, the other areas start to work themselves out. You need to start investing in things like systems, automation, feedback loops, and metrics dashboards.\r\n\r\nHow do you Become a Truly Scalable Product Manager?\r\n\r\nJosh\u2019s short answer to that question is: \u201cyou can\u2019t.\u201d To be truly scalable, you can\u2019t be a product manager; you need to be a product leader. To become a product leader, you need to start letting things go and sharing them with the rest of your team. Josh explains that many product managers become hoarders of things like:\r\n\r\nVision . A product manager creates and shares their grand vision with the team, whereas a product leader creates a shared vision with the team, and continues to evangelize it.\r\n\r\nUsers. Product managers regularly talk to users, whereas product leaders ensure that the entire team is regularly talking to users.\r\n\r\nLearning. Products managers are always learning, whereas product leaders are always teaching.\r\n\r\nAnswers. Product managers give the right answers, whereas product leaders ask the right questions.\r\n\r\nDecisions. Product managers make all of the decisions, whereas product leaders delegate all of the decisions.\r\n\r\nPower and Control. Product managers retain power and control, whereas product leaders distribute power and control.\r\n\r\nEfforts. Product managers\u2019 direct efforts of those in their company, whereas product leaders inspire efforts of those in their company and beyond.\r\n\r\nIn his conclusion, Josh reminds us that being a product leader is a matter of combining effectiveness and scalability. You need to be building the right products, but also building them the right way and thinking large scale and outside the conventional ways of getting things done. Being a leader is also very much about being a member of your team, rather than overseeing your team. Product managers create products, but product leaders create \u201cmovements\u201d or experiences.\r\n\r\nShare Share +1 Email Shares 277","title":"The Evolution of a Product Manager","url":"http:\/\/www.mindtheproduct.com\/2017\/05\/evolution-product-manager-josh-mcwilliam\/","labels":["product management"]},{"body":"","title":"4 Steps to Defining GREAT Metrics for ANY Product","url":"https:\/\/hackernoon.com\/metrics-game-framework-5e3dce1be8ac","labels":["product discovery","product growth","product management","sales"]},{"body":"","title":"What Jobs-To-Be-Done research can teach you about your users, your product and your company","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@Productized\/what-jobs-to-be-done-research-can-teach-you-about-your-users-your-product-and-your-company-b5240089c95b","labels":["company culture","company growth","product discovery","product growth","product management","sales"]},{"body":"Have you ever wondered what qualities investors look for in a startup to consider it fundable? Benjamin Chong, a partner at Right Click Capital and a Co-Director of the Sydney Founder Institute, has created a three question test to help determine your answer in the article \u201cThree ways to test if your startup is fundable,\u201d on BRW.\r\n\r\nMany entrepreneurs feel their problems will be solved with funding, but being fundable is very different from being in need of funding. Being fundable is all about your startup\u2019s potential to attract financing so you can grow your business. All startup need some kind of funding to survive but not all are considered fundable.\r\n\r\nIs your startup fundable? Read on to see what Benjamin Chong has say on the matter.\r\n\r\n1. Are you solving a real problem?\r\n\r\nWhen launching a startup, keep in mind that your company has to offer a real value to the world, or at least a part of it, before you seek funding. Here are some questions for you to consider:\r\n\r\nWhat is the problem your startup is trying to solve?\r\n\r\nIs it a real problem or a perceived one?\r\n\r\nHave potential customers confirmed you\u2019re solving a real problem?\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s the market size of the problem?\r\n\r\nLast week, I was presented with an idea for a personal electronic device that could help when paying for items at the cash register. While it was an interesting idea, I couldn\u2019t see a real problem that the device was solving.\u201d\r\n\r\n2. Do you have a killer team?\r\n\r\nGreat minds think alike, so building your startup team is extremely important. Investors look for teams of individuals with a combination of technical background, business skills, and industry experience that are driven to succeed.\r\n\r\nA great way to gain experience is by joining a startup and contributing to the success of a fledgling business. I\u2019ve previously employed-future entrepreneurs, who\u2019ve added immense value to our businesses. At the same time, they\u2019ve gained an understanding of the frenetic pace of an early-stage business and developed skills from financial modelling to phone sales to graphic design.\u201d\r\n\r\n3. Are you gaining traction?\r\n\r\nA startup with little to no traction will not pique the interest of investors. Make sure you are establishing a solid customer base and gaining traction over time. This will help investors determine if your startup is viable. Below are several questions that must be addressed before pushing your startup to the next level:\r\n\r\nDo you have users or customers?\r\n\r\nIs the rate of user growth increasing?\r\n\r\nHave you been able to charge customers for your product or service?","title":"Is Your Startup Fundable?","url":"http:\/\/FI.co\/posts\/13491","labels":["startup fundamentals"]},{"body":"","title":"10 Resources to Help You Grow a Lean Startup","url":"https:\/\/blog.producthunt.com\/10-resources-to-help-you-grow-a-lean-startup-aad02b2354c","labels":["startup fundamentals"]},{"body":"","title":"From pipes to platforms: Leveraging the network effect","url":"https:\/\/inform.tmforum.org\/internet-of-everything\/2017\/04\/pipes-platforms-leveraging-network-effect\/","labels":["branding"]},{"body":"This is a very short summary with lots left out\u2014here is the long version: http:\/\/startupclass.samaltman.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou should start with an idea, not a company. When it\u2019s just an idea or project, the stakes are lower and you\u2019re more willing to entertain outlandish-sounding but potentially huge ideas. The best way to start a company is to build interesting projects.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when you have a \u201ccompany\u201d that you feel pressure to commit to an idea too quickly. If it\u2019s just a project, you can spend more time finding something great to work on, which is important\u2014if the startup really works, you\u2019ll probably be working on it for a very long time.\r\n\r\nHave at least one technical founder on the team (i.e. someone who can build whatever the company is going to build).\r\n\r\nIn general, prefer a fast-growing market to a large but slow-growing one, especially if you have conviction the fast-growing market is going to be important but others dismiss it as unimportant.\r\n\r\nThe best startup ideas are the ones that seem like bad ideas but are good ideas.\r\n\r\nMake something people want. You can screw up most other things if you get this right; if you don\u2019t, nothing else will save you.\r\n\r\nOnce you\u2019ve shifted from \u201cinteresting project\u201d to \u201ccompany\u201d mode, be decisive and act quickly. Instead of thinking about making a decision over the course of week, think about making it in an hour, and getting it done in the next hour.\r\n\r\nBecome formidable. Also become tough\u2014the road ahead is going to be painful and make you doubt yourself many, many times.\r\n\r\nFigure out a way to get your product in front of users. Start manually (read this: http:\/\/www.paulgraham.com\/ds.html)\r\n\r\nListen to what your users tell you, improve your product, and then listen again. Keep doing this until you\u2019ve made something some users love (one of the many brilliant Paul Buchheit observations is that it\u2019s better to build something a small number of users love than something a lot of users like). Don\u2019t deceive yourself about whether or not your users actually love your product.\r\n\r\nKeep your burn rate very low until you\u2019re sure you\u2019ve built something people love. The easiest way to do this is hire slowly.\r\n\r\nHave a strategy. Most people don\u2019t. Occasionally take a little bit of time to think about how you\u2019re executing against your strategy. Specifically, remember that someday you need to have a monopoly (in the Peter Thiel sense).\r\n\r\nRead this before you raise money: http:\/\/paulgraham.com\/fr.html.\r\n\r\nLearn to ask for what you want.\r\n\r\nIgnore what the press says about you, especially if it\u2019s complimentary.\r\n\r\nGenerate revenue early in the life of your company.\r\n\r\nHire the best people you can. However much time you\u2019re spending on this, it\u2019s probably not enough. Give a lot of equity to your employees, and have very high expectations. Smart, effective people are critical to success. Read this: http:\/\/blog.samaltman.com\/how-to-hire.\r\n\r\nFire people quickly when you make hiring mistakes.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t work with people you don\u2019t have a good feeling about\u2014this goes for employees (and cofounders), partners, investors, etc.\r\n\r\nFigure out a way to get users at scale (i.e. bite the bullet and learn how sales and marketing work). Incidentally, while it is currently in fashion, spending more than the lifetime value of your users to acquire them is not an acceptable strategy.\r\n\r\nObsess about your growth rate, and never stop. The company will build what the CEO measures. If you ever catch yourself saying \u201cwe\u2019re not really focused on growth right now\u201d, think very carefully about the possibility you\u2019re focused on the wrong thing. Also, don\u2019t let yourself be deceived by vanity metrics.\r\n\r\nEventually, the company needs to evolve to become a mission that everyone, but especially the founders, are exceptionally dedicated to. The \u201cmissionaries vs. mercenaries\u201d soundbite is overused but true.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t waste your time on stuff that doesn\u2019t matter (i.e. things other than building your product, talking to your users, growing, etc.). In general, avoid the kind of stuff that might be in a movie about running a startup\u2014meeting with lawyers and accountants, going to lots of conferences, grabbing coffee with people, sitting in lots of meetings, etc. Become a Delaware C Corp (use Clerky or any well-known Silicon Valley law firm) and then get back to work on your product.\r\n\r\nFocus intensely on the things that do matter. Every day, figure out what the 2 or 3 most important things for you to do are. Do those and ignore other distractions. Be a relentless execution machine.\r\n\r\nDo what it takes and don\u2019t make up excuses.\r\n\r\nLearn to manage people. Make sure your employees are happy. Don\u2019t ignore this.\r\n\r\nIn addition to building a great product, if you want to be really successful, you also have to build a great company. So think a lot about your culture.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t underestimate the importance of personal connections.\r\n\r\nIgnore acquisition interest until you are sure you want to sell. Don\u2019t \u201ccheck the market\u201d. There is an alternate universe somewhere full of companies that would have been great if they could have just avoided this one mistake. Unfortunately, in this universe, they\u2019re all dead.\r\n\r\nWork really hard. Everyone wants a secret to success other than this; if it exists, I haven\u2019t found it yet.\r\n\r\nKeep doing this for 10 years.","title":"Startup advice, briefly","url":"http:\/\/blog.samaltman.com\/startup-advice-briefly","labels":["startup fundamentals"]},{"body":"","title":"CULTURE DEFINITION: IMPROVING YOUR ORGANIZATION\u2019S CULTURE TO GROW AND INNOVATE.","url":"https:\/\/www.corporateculturepros.com\/culture-definition-revolution-improve-business-innovation-growth\/","labels":["company culture"]},{"body":"Yes.

Open floor plans for houses, simple and sleek lines on sports cars, and products. The iPhone really started the trend, with a simple yet sleek phone. No need for flip phones with gimmicks. Personally I believe design should be simple and clean, and if you want to make it stand out you should add a subtle change.\r\n\r\nBelow is an infographic by Martin Eriksson that perfectly describes a product manager\u2019s position. As a product manager I need to be business minded, understand the user experience and understand technology. A good product manager understands the aspects of all three circles and must understand how to merge them together. What\u2019s important for you to understand is that product managers don\u2019t need to be the best. There\u2019s a reason that you\u2019re not one whole circle.\r\n\r\nAnother interpretation of the infographic is that you bind them all together.

Like the insect, the startup supports that which is many times its own size. It serves its 20 million registered users \u2014 who have saved over 2 billion articles and videos for later \u2014 with a team of just 20 employees.\n\nAt the center of this supernatural ability and efficiency is founder and CEO Nate Weiner. Pocket just celebrated its eighth birthday \u2014 but for roughly half of the company\u2019s existence, Weiner was the sole employee. On his own, he built and designed Pocket\u2019s website, API, iPhone app and iPad app, and fielded support requests from his first few million users.\n\nPocket is proof that size of team doesn\u2019t equal scale of impact. In this exclusive interview, Weiner explains why scaling a company doesn\u2019t always mean increasing headcount (and burn). Instead, he shares the two ways startups can grow a business without a marketing or sales team, and the incredible advantages of staying small for focus, culture and trust. Any early-stage company that seeks to punch above its weight can benefit from Weiner\u2019s exceptional (in more ways than one) experience with growth.\n\nNearly four years into Pocket, Weiner decided to raise money to turn his one-man-show into a team. How many people would he need? For someone who built the first version of Pocket on his own in a night, five people seemed like a lot. \u201cI asked myself, \u2018What the hell would five people do?\u2019\u201d Weiner says. \u201cEvernote (which had made a bid to buy Pocket in its early, early days) employed around 60 people when I first started talking to them. I couldn\u2019t fathom having a team that size. What would they work on? Why\u2019s a team of ten working on what one person can do?\u201d\n\nToday, Pocket is in the process of moving into a new office to fit its now quickly growing team (targeted at two dozen by year-end), so it\u2019s clear that success has shifted Weiner\u2019s perspective, at least a little. Still, he maintains how Pocket\u2019s sustained smaller size in its early years was formative to its long-standing winning streak. And even now, he doesn\u2019t want any sudden moves to lose or dilute the very traits that got the company where it is today: focus and trust. Below, he shares how keeping a team small can be an invaluable guiding principle.\n\nForce Focus with a Smaller Headcount \u2014 Either Real or Simulated\n\nManagement mantras harp on the importance of focus and staying nimble for startups. But they tend to leave practitioners to will clarity and agility into reality. Like any other startup, Pocket struggles with staying focused while prioritizing the many inbound or upcoming opportunities it\u2019s always juggling. Unlike most companies, it views its small headcount as a means \u2014 not a limitation \u2014 to focus.\n\nFor the first quarter of this year, Pocket had over 20 projects on the docket across the entire company \u2014 that is, more projects than employees. \u201cFocus is an enduring battle for a company of any size,\u201d says Weiner. \u201cIf we were a larger company, we might\u2019ve been tempted to elect a lead for each project, allocate engineers and push ahead on all fronts. But our limited resources prompt frequent reflection and rigorous prioritization.\u201d\n\nPocket only completed one-fourth of its projects slated for the first quarter. With so much in motion, the team felt dispersed and directionless. \u201cIt didn't feel good,\u201d says Weiner. \u201cThen we got word of a marquee project: Mozilla wanted to build Pocket into every version of Firefox that people downloaded. That integration caused the entire company to focus on one thing. It took me back to the early days when we were just five people, and how we attacked one goal at a time with all of us behind it. We rallied together to do the integration quickly, all while furthering Pocket\u2019s mission of giving more people access to the content they want for later enjoyment.\"\n\nIf you lead a small startup, ask yourself: restrictions aside, would I put the entire company behind this project? If the answer is yes, find a way to do it. \u201cWith everyone on the Firefox project, we moved so much faster, the quality of the product was way better and people were amped up,\u201d says Weiner. \u201cThen we went on to the next project \u2014 with more momentum, coordination and energy than if we decided to divide and conquer our list of projects.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re over 100 employees, find a way to manufacture the same scenario. Think back to the time when your company could fit into one room, and ask yourself if you\u2019d put everyone on the project if you could. If the answer is yes, consider deploying more reinforcements from your current team. \u201cEven at 20, 30 or even 50 people, you should really just be focused on that one thing that needs to happen right now,\u201d says Weiner.\n\n\u201cI understand that bigger companies cannot shift the same way startups can, but it\u2019s keeping that instinct sharp and active that\u2019s key,\u201d says Weiner. \u201cPersonally, I know I need that focus forced on me. The more people you add, the easier it is to keep doing what\u2019s not critically important. With a smaller team, it\u2019s very hard not to stay focused. You constantly need to avoid doing what you want to do in the future for that which has to be done now.\u201d\n\nFor companies of any size, Weiner suggests putting the full team on the most critical project every quarter. \u201cOver the next 90 days, what\u2019s going to be the project that makes the difference? Let\u2019s just make sure that we hit that goal the best we can and then we can move onto the next project.\u201d\n\nPocket is now shortening its project runway to under 30 days \u2014 especially for engineering sprints. \u201cI can tell you where we're going six months from now, but we try to focus a month at a time. A small team enables us to operate this way,\u201d says Weiner.\n\nCondense Your Culture But Expand Your Skillset\n\nAt larger companies, entire roles or departments are charged with defining and preserving culture in order to absorb hundreds of new hires. As Pocket\u2019s sole employee for its early years, Weiner was both the only creator and custodian of its culture. While he knew he eventually needed more than one person to scale the company, he didn\u2019t want to lose the drive and grit that had landed him early success.\n\nWith a small headcount, Weiner was able to keep Pocket\u2019s culture concentrated during its formative years. This was possible because its culture wasn\u2019t a fuzzy concept \u2014 it meant trust, scrappiness and ownership. Weiner had years to discover and refine founder-culture fit with the same rigor that most apply to find product-market fit for their companies. After all, there\u2019s a saying in tech that 80% of your eventual culture is your founder (literally their personality traits).\n\nThink stews not salads when it comes to company culture. Start by letting a few choice ingredients simmer together. Then taste. You\u2019ll have a better palate for what it delivers and lacks than if you toss it all together from the start.\n\nThis hard-earned clarity allows Weiner to confidently hire in his image while gradually growing the team and diversifying its skillset. \u201cAs with all startups, at some point you realize you can\u2019t do it all to completion or to a high standard. For example, I really needed help with design,\u201d said Weiner. \u201cNikki, our Head of Design, was the first hire. I had the engineering and product experience, but she brought the design chops that we needed to truly make a great product. She changed the black and yellow color scheme \u2014 that had somehow looked good to me at the time \u2014 to what Pocket looks like today. It's been vital to bring on people who own and value their part of Pocket as much as I have from the start. They\u2019ve made it better than I could have.\u201d\n\nKeeping Pocket around 20 employees has allowed Weiner to not only personally filter for those he can trust, but also assemble a group capable of making decisions and operating without him. With a small team, those bonds and common world view form more quickly without complex hierarchies in the way. \u201cAs a technical founder, engineering was the hardest area to let go,\u201d says Weiner. \u201cEarly on though, I remember when it finally clicked: We had an issue with our back-end. I suggested an idea on how to resolve it. The team noted it, and then went to another room to sort it out. The solution that they came up with was way better than mine. It was a great moment to realize how it was okay to let go, and that it often turns out better when there\u2019s acknowledged and mutual trust.\u201d\n\nA small startup can use its size to force focus and better preserve culture as it grows, but these benefits are just the fuel for the work the team has to do. Its output \u2014 the actual product \u2014 can also scale without increasing headcount, but only through two channels. \u201cThe only way a product can grow from a team of our size is if your platform carries you or your users carry you,\u201d says Weiner.\n\nThe advantage of being small is that you find ways to make people outside of your walls part of your company.\n\nHere\u2019s how Pocket develops, ships and publicizes its product through its platform and with the help of its loyal users:\n\nHere\u2019s How Your Platform Can Carry You\n\nIn the early days, Weiner made it his goal to embed Pocket in every corner of the web. The intent was to create an \u201camazing consumption experience\u201d for as many people as possible across all of their devices, which meant the app itself had to be extremely flexible and scalable.\n\nWithout a sales or marketing team, Pocket made its app as simple and straightforward for other companies to learn about and integrate its service \u2014 which, in turn, has exponentially grown Pocket\u2019s users. To date, the company has tallied over 2,000 integrations, among them Firefox, Twitter, Flipboard, and Kobo.\n\nWith strong partner feedback and enthusiasm, Pocket now seeks to grow as fast as it can through its platform. Weiner sees tons of opportunities, but there\u2019s more out there than Pocket could possibly build with its current team \u2014 even if headcount doubled instantly.\n\nAs a small, fast-growing company, you can go on a hiring spree or lean on your platform. If you opt for the latter, here\u2019s Weiner\u2019s advice:\n\nMake it dead simple and low-lift.\n\nThe team at Pocket relies on this question to make decisions: how can we make it simpler for all involved? For example, it\u2019s now commonplace for startups to share their APIs, but Pocket takes it a step further. \u201cYes, the APIs that we build on as a company are the exact same APIs we give to every partner publicly. But can you help them with just a few lines of code?\u201d asks Weiner.\n\nYears ago, Weiner took on this challenge with the help of ShareKit, an open source Software Development Kit (SDK) that people could drop into their iOS apps. \u201cI tried to make it literally one line of code for people to add Pocket and other popular services to what they were building.\u201d says Weiner. \u201cCompanies could drop the line of code in and their app could share to any service like Twitter, Tumblr or Facebook. At the time, if you had to write the code from scratch on your own, it was weeks of work to set these things up. But I still wanted to make it simpler.\u201d This is the same philosophy that guides Pocket today.\n\nAs much as possible, make it truly plug-and-play for others who want to build in your product. \u201cIf Twitter comes to us and wants to integrate Pocket, we\u2019ve lost if it takes them a month to do it,\u201d says Weiner. \u201cThey\u2019re simply not going to do it. And I don\u2019t blame them.\u201d\n\nNot requiring people to reinvent the wheel means first making sure what you\u2019re working with is as simple as a wheel. If it is, they\u2019ll use it and there won\u2019t be much reinventing needed.\n\nStructure integration as self-help.\n\nPocket\u2019s platform mentality has been a huge part of its growth. Allowing companies to build on its platform easily has been the first step, but scale happens when they can do so independently. \u201cWe\u2019ve completed thousands of integrations without any business development \u2014 and the overwhelming majority without any support,\u201d says Weiner.\n\nSimplicity has made it easy for partners to integrate Pocket, but the startup\u2019s size has made it a necessity. \u201cThe deals with Kobo and Firefox only happened because we made it easy for them to self-serve,\u201d says Weiner. \u201cAt first, Kobo asked us to integrate Pocket in two months. If our team of a dozen people (at the time) had to build it from scratch, it would have never happened. But we said, \u2018Here\u2019s our API.' Kobo was able to integrate Pocket within 14 days.\u201d\n\nFor integration, the ideal is when companies can incorporate Pocket without ever reaching out to Weiner or his team. Pocket has found that its users typically request other apps to integrate the save-for-later service, which is what prompts new companies to learn about Pocket. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard a few times that the number one feature request for apps is integrating Pocket. When companies look into it, they\u2019re happy to check the request off the list on their own,\u201d says Weiner. \u201cThat\u2019s how Facebook Paper integrated Pocket. I had nothing to do with that \u2014 I just found out one day.\u201d\n\nWoo big partners tenaciously with your platform, then keep them with transparency.\n\nSimple platform integration and self-service doesn\u2019t mean that startups should go on autopilot. Pocket stays on the radar of strategic companies that it believes will benefit from its product. For example, the first time that Pocket reached out to Firefox it was still known as Read-it-Later. \u201cWe started as a Firefox extension and I was one of the extension app reviewers early on,\u201d says Weiner. \u201cWe\u2019ve built the type of culture where we share our story, data and updates early and along the way, so companies \u2014 from major content services to device manufacturers \u2014 understand what it\u2019s like to be our partner from the beginning. We want them to truly know \u2014 and be able to point to proof \u2014 that we\u2019re ready when they are. One day, it clicked and Mozilla called. It\u2019s now fully integrated Pocket as the save-for-later service for its Firefox browser.\u201d\n\nRemember: getting an app or company on your platform marks the end of a deal, but the beginning of an official working relationship. For Pocket, channeling \u201cgenerous transparency\u201d is the way it retains its partners and continues to improve its product with such a small team. \u201cWe try to share knowledge as much as possible. We don\u2019t try to hide anything. We tell Apple and Google what we\u2019re seeing in the market when they\u2019re working on their share sheets,\u201d says Weiner. \u201cAs a result, it's made it really easy for us to actually start getting these deals done as people want to solve their save-for-later needs. They know who to turn to.\u201d\n\nThe takeaway for lean startups is to construct a platform that can enable external parties to operate as extensions of your team: sales, engineering and business intelligence. In the case of Pocket, its platform is simple to integrate, built for self-service and brings with it an increasingly rich set of data, that when aggregated, benefits all its partnering companies. \u201cWhat\u2019s next is leveraging our user base. While we have a hundreds of companies integrating Pocket, we have millions of users,\u201d says Weiner. \u201cThe question now is: how can we serve them and also help them carry us even further?\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s How Your Users Can Carry You\n\n\u201cThink back to what it was like to watch television before DVR or streaming. Or what it felt like to hail a cab without Uber,\u201d says Weiner. \u201cWhenever you find a place that feels old, people get really passionate about it, because the new way has become so core to their experience and going back to the old way just feels broken. With Pocket, I think we\u2019ve hit upon a very different way of using content on the web. We have users that, when they go into another app where they can\u2019t save to Pocket, say, \u2018Is this an ancient time? What\u2019s going on here?\u2019\u201d\n\nSmall startups who have users expressing this degree of passion should not miss the opportunity to direct that energy from expression into creation for the benefit of the company. For Pocket, that\u2019s meant getting users to lend a helping hand to product development. Here are the two ways that Pocket\u2019s users are supporting its next generation of products.\n\nShift your Beta channel from delivery to conversation to co-creation.\n\nWhen Pocket started, its release philosophy was about pushing out an airtight product to its users. The team would perfect every pixel before launch. \u201cAt the beginning, Pocket was a very waterfall-like product,\u201d says Weiner. \u201cWe would deliver big releases about once a year. We\u2019d go underground for six months and build something big and then we'd launch it. The releases were well received, but we suspected we should have been getting more out of our process.\u2019\u201d\n\nYet, after product-market fit, perfect is not only the enemy of good, but of growth. \u201cPocket is known as a very well-designed experience and app,\u201d says Weiner. \u201cWhile we want to keep that up, our development debates shifted from every nitpicking detail to how we open up and solve growth problems. As a small team at a growing company, we needed to tap into our users as collaborators, not just as beneficiaries.\u201d\n\nThere comes a point for every startup when you\u2019ve got to decide between perfection and progression. The first is a stable characteristic and the second is a dynamic conversation. Choose wisely.\n\nOff the bat, that means having more frequent interactions with users. Getting them involved in product development isn\u2019t just about opening the floodgates \u2014 it requires restructuring the way your team works. Pocket has moved to a faster release cycle to have more touchpoints with its users. \u201cWe're moving to a much faster cadence. Our sprints are a few weeks long and we\u2019re closing in on a five to six week release cycle. For the team, it\u2019s a far cry \u2014 and a cultural shift \u2014 from trying to get everything perfect before the public sees it. Now, we know there are bugs in what we ship, but now we aren\u2019t the only ones squashing them.\u201d\n\nThis approach was especially critical to Pocket 6.0, a prototype that the company uses internally. The team estimated that a full, public-ready version would take nine months to put out. \u201cWe were delighted by the beta and didn\u2019t want our limitations to delay our users from experiencing it, too,\u201d says Weiner. \u201cSo we decided to break it all apart. We laid out the five to six different releases that\u2019d strategically get us there over a six week release cycle. So far, it\u2019s felt good to get it out there, even if it\u2019s piece by piece. We're getting feedback and signal back really fast. We listen, respond and incorporate it all. We also ship at the same time so users know they\u2019re being heard \u2014 they\u2019re like our remote team.\"\n\nIf you have one arrow and you shoot and miss, you're screwed. If you can continually re-aim until you get to the target, that gives you a much better look at the bullseye.\n\nUsed correctly, a Beta channel can give your team great feedback and allow your users to direct the product. Even if you haven\u2019t hired, you\u2019ll feel like you have more manpower to hit milestones and additional insights into fast-moving markets. \u201cAfter our last fundraise, we set a lot of important milestones, especially around getting additions to the platform built out,\u201d says Weiner. \u201cWe know that we want to get them out there to validate and prove them in the market. The sooner that we can do that, the better. The beta channel\u2019s the way forward for Pocket and the way in for our users.\u201d\n\nUse surveys to learn from \"the PMs\" among your users.\n\nFrom the beginning, Weiner was struck by the enthusiasm and loyalty of Pocket users. \u201cOur users love this product. I'm always blown away by how avid and vocal our fans can be,\u201d says Weiner. \u201cWe get emails all the time from people writing in to say, \u2018Hey. I don't have a bug. I just wanted to tell you guys that you\u2019re awesome.\u2019\u201d\n\nTo fully engage this type of fanbase, use tools to solicit and leverage their support. Pocket has used surveys to not only collect feedback but also to directly guide its product roadmap. \u201cWe\u2019re actually just reviewing 600 responses from a survey that we put out in our beta version of Pocket,\u201d says Weiner. \u201cOur support team is having conversations with people directly inside the product. We\u2019ve actually received more feedback than ever through this channel.\u201d\n\nMany startups use surveys as an engagement tool, and casually treat the results as a byproduct. Don\u2019t just listen, really hear what\u2019s being said and how. \u201cI always remind the team to look past the basic gist of the results,\u201d says Weiner.\n\nWhen users give you feedback on an obstacle, they almost always give you an idea on how to solve it.\n\n\"They don\u2019t just say, 'I hate that this is the case.' If you keep reading, they\u2019ll often include, 'You should let me pin this or swipe it away.' It may not be the solution in the end, but it will better define the challenge, which gets you closer to a solution.\u201d\n\nFor example, Pocket now has two tabs, \u201cMy List\u201d and \u201cRecommendations,\u201d at the top of the app. Results from the survey indicated that people wanted to swipe between the two lists, but that many users couldn\u2019t reach their finger all the way to the top. \u201cThat was insightful, but it was also just one solution,\u201d says Weiner. \u201cThe other option may be a standard UI convention on iOS, where you can bring the tab bar down to the bottom. All of sudden now, that's within reach of your thumb. But then, you also have to think about Facebook or other places where the new functionality may not be discoverable for a lot of users and many will have the same problem. If you jump to the first, second or tenth solution, you\u2019re missing the point of fully grasping the need of implementing swipeable tabs.\u201d\n\nLastly, when running surveys, keep in mind these three tips from Weiner:\n\nSegment your users into buckets . Pocket has divided its user base into \u201ccasual,\u201d \u201ccore,\u201d and \u201cinactive.\u201d The team makes sure to send surveys to a group within each category to ensure they\u2019re learning from a representative sample.\n\nLower the bar for participation . Pocket makes sure its surveys are easy to complete, which means they are less than five minutes long. Oftentimes, they\u2019re even shorter. For the most part, the team prefers releasing two-questions surveys frequently than a ten-question survey released occasionally.\n\nDrop in surveys at multiple junctures. Pocket continues to experiment with where and how it surveys users. Like most apps, there\u2019s a send feedback button (in beta for Pocket) that is a passive channel. Or an email will capture those who may not open the app every day. Also, after five minutes of inactivity in the app, Pocket may pop up with a live chat and ask: \u201cHey. Everything OK?\u201d\n\nUsing tools to engage users, like surveys and Beta channels, and creating easy, low-lift ways for partners to extend and build on your platform are ways to scale your company without growing your headcount. That\u2019s how Pocket continues to deliver despite its size. However, now that Pocket\u2019s partners and users are becoming more active in shaping the future, they\u2019re also influencing the startup\u2019s definition of success.\n\n\u201cBack before we raised money, I kept saying that save for later is a system-level feature that needs to built into browsers and operating systems. People told me that would never happen. Years later we\u2019re built into Firefox,\u201d says Weiner. \u201cOur strategy has been to first create a way to capture anything you find and want to save \u2014 regardless of the app or service \u2014 and get embedded with the partners to make that universal. Then it\u2019s to create an amazing set of tools to consume content. This has given us incredible insights on information consumption and, soon, how to solve its challenges. There\u2019s always a next goal, but it\u2019s the same question that drives us: How do we help people get all the great stuff that\u2019s out there?\u201d\n\nThe key for Pocket \u2014 or any startup \u2014 is to tackle a colossal and ambitious goal with leverage. \u201cRight now, we really want to get our platform to scale even more and reach as many people as possible,\u201d says Weiner. \u201cWe want them to not only enjoy what we create, but help us build it. If for each Pocket employee, there\u2019s a hundred partners and millions of users to help, we\u2019ll have the muscle to make it all happen.\u201d","title":"The Story Behind How Pocket Hit 20M Users with 20 People | First Round Review","url":"http:\/\/firstround.com\/review\/the-story-behind-how-pocket-hit-20m-users-with-20-people\/","labels":["people management"]},{"body":"","title":"How to Distinguish Between Your Product Roadmap, Product Strategy, and Product Vision","url":"https:\/\/community.uservoice.com\/blog\/how-to-distinguish-between-your-product-roadmap-product-strategy-and-product-vision\/","labels":["product discovery","product growth","product management","sales"]},{"body":"","title":"Classification \/ Types of Mergers","url":"https:\/\/efinancemanagement.com\/mergers-and-acquisitions\/classification-types-of-mergers","labels":[]},{"body":"","title":"Hiring, the Single Most Important Skill as a Founder","url":"https:\/\/www.techstars.com\/content\/accelerators\/boston\/hiring-the-single-most-important-skill-as-a-founder\/","labels":["interpersonal skills","sales"]},{"body":"","title":"Porter\u2019s Five Forces of Competitive Position Analysis","url":"https:\/\/www.cgma.org\/resources\/tools\/essential-tools\/porters-five-forces.html","labels":[]},{"body":"","title":"5 insights for improving product development cycle success","url":"https:\/\/www.cooper.com\/journal\/2017\/1\/5_insights_for_improving_produ","labels":["company growth","investment cycle","product discovery","product growth","product management","sales"]},{"body":"","title":"TOP 10 MUST-HAVE SKILLS FOR STARTUP SUCCESS","url":"https:\/\/evoma.com\/business-centre\/top-10-must-have-skills-for-startup-success\/","labels":["interpersonal skills","startup fundamentals"]},{"body":"","title":"What is Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) and Why Is It Important?","url":"https:\/\/www.invespcro.com\/blog\/what-is-conversion-rate-optimization\/","labels":["sales"]},{"body":"As today marks my first day as an Entrepreneur -in- Residence at Trinity Ventures , I'm spending a lot of time thinking about how to formalize my process for starting a new venture. Every startup goes through phases including brainstorming ideas, selecting evaluation criteria, performing due diligence on top ideas, picking a winner, deciding on a corporate structure , putting together the team, evaluating funding options, and more. While the popular press often glamorizes the startup story as an epiphany moment from an opportunistic individual that grows to a successful corporate behemoth, I prefer a much more systematic approach to entrepreneurship (and life in general, for that matter). As I begin this journey myself, I thought I'd document my new venture process along the way, share it with all of you, and hopefully hear from you on your own thoughts.Often one of the earliest steps in forming a new venture is coming up with the idea. I won't argue that this should necessarily be the first step though, since in my previous venture Anywhere.FM we picked the team before the idea and that was the right choice for us. I also won't argue that it is necessarily the most important step, because while a startup needs a great idea, it's not without great execution that an idea can become a successful endeavor.I'm often asked where I come up with all my ideas, as I'm typically chock-full of potential ideas percolating in my head. I have a variety of sources of inspiration that help me put together laundry lists of potential startup opportunities. Before I dive into my muses though, I think what's important to realize is that the best idea brainstorming happens outside of any specific brainstorming phase. Good idea generation is like a muscle that you are constantly flexing. It's a mindset and attitude towards the problems you face everyday and your ability to effect change. While some people are innately curious and problem solvers, I still think like any muscle, this skill is something that can exercised and improved.I'm personally innately curious. But what has been a huge boon for me was learning to program on my first computer, an Apple IIc , when I was in middle school. I quickly learned BASIC and fell in love with the idea that I could make things. In the early days it was often games to amuse myself (which is what typically attracts many young boys to programming), but as time passed I started making more useful applications. One of the issues I had early on was quizzing myself on vocabulary words. I quickly wrote a program I called Vocabulary Master to provide me random word definitions, give me three attempts to guess the word correctly, and tell me the word if I failed to remember it. It was a very simple application, but was the foundation for my strong belief that I can solve real world problems through software. Ever since then I've constantly had a list of potential ideas. Oftentimes when something bothers me or I think that something can be improved, I add it to a list of potential projects (and I have to say that I love the fact that now I have an iPhone always in my pocket to record my ideas ). It's this critical lens of looking for ways to improve what you see every day and having the attitude that you can do something about it that I think makes for a great base of idea generation.Beyond that, there are specific muses I've used to help jump start my creative juices:I think often the best source of ideas comes from your area of expertise and the problems you face on a day-to-day basis in your career. You probably find yourself saying \"Why is this so hard? There has got to be an easier way\" every so often. It may be a product extension to your existing business's core products, or may be unrelated to the business, but a pain point you feel trying to get your job done. From my experience at imeem focusing on monetization, I've come up with countless pain points in trying to monetize social media and large publisher sites that could be fruitful startup opportunities.I think another very important exercise is analyzing macroeconomic trends and thinking about the opportunities it creates. What obviously comes to mind first these days is the recession, and I think a lot of startup opportunities will come out of that. Anywhere from helping people save money, find jobs, or tapping into the funds made available through the stimulus bill. But beyond the recession, I think there are a lot of other exciting market trends that are creating countless opportunities. Anywhere from the proliferation of APIs , to the rise of cloud platforms , to the opening up of mobile devices I believe there remains significant inefficiency in applying new technologies across multiple vertical applications. It behooves a startup to focus at least initially on a very specific application to prove out the model and to provide the best experience. But this creates significant opportunity for other startups to bring that existing technology innovation to new verticals and thus becomes a fruitful source of startup ideas. I often think about how trends in certain spaces can be applied to new segments. For example, can we bring the viral spreading of applications native to Facebook apps to iPhone applications? Or can we bring the successful virtual goods monetization model from social games to non-gaming sites If you have a specific area of interest or vertical segment that excites you, I think its hugely valuable to constantly keep up with the latest news in that area. These days its so easy to use Google Alerts to subscribe to daily feeds of the latest news, blogs, and search results of your topic of choice. I have these setup for various areas of interest, including open platforms and personal productivity.I think it's also very important to constantly be exposed to new startup ideas. When you hear people's ideas and their take on solving them, it definitely helps to get your own mind thinking about related opportunities in the space or at least helps to think critically about how they may have come up with such a solution. I daily skim TechCrunch as a great source of startup ideas. I think Jessica Livingston's Founders at Work was also a great case study of many different startup ideas.As I said, great entrepreneurs have this ability to constantly come up with ideas and potential solutions. I've been spending the last month catching up with a lot of my fellow entrepreneurs to not only chat about their business, but more importantly, interesting things that they have seen outside of their own startup. When an entrepreneur is busy executing against a specific idea, he is knee deep in one specific space. That doesn't mean though that he doesn't think about other ideas or have other ideas percolating in his head. I think its often great to tap into this creative thinking to spur some of your own ideas.","title":"My Muses for Brainstorming Startup Ideas","url":"http:\/\/www.sachinrekhi.com\/my-muses-for-brainstorming-startup-ideas","labels":["agile principles","startup fundamentals"]},{"body":"","title":"Agile Is The New Waterfall\u200a\u2014\u200aA Followup","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/swlh\/agile-is-the-new-waterfall-a-followup-f1c0bcd2162e","labels":["agile principles"]},{"body":"","title":"DIVERSITY VS.

I hope these thoughts and questions are helpful when thinking about your recruiting process:","title":"Debugging Recruiting","url":"https:\/\/news.greylock.com\/debugging-recruiting-9e711654fddb","labels":["marketing"]},{"body":"","title":"Market Entry Strategy: Definition & Example","url":"https:\/\/www.mbaskool.com\/business-concepts\/marketing-and-strategy-terms\/7313-market-entry.html","labels":["agile principles","branding","business fundamentals","interpersonal skills","marketing","product management","sales"]},{"body":"","title":"[Pt 2] Selling \u2018Jobs to be Done\u2019: Who\u2019s the Customer?","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/frameplay\/pt-2-selling-jobs-to-be-done-who-s-the-customer-e3a5f80ba527","labels":["product management","sales"]},{"body":"","title":"The right type of customer conversations","url":"https:\/\/blog.intercom.com\/the-right-type-of-customer-conversations\/","labels":["product management"]},{"body":"","title":"4 Ways to Leverage Marketing Trends for Viral Growth","url":"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/297435","labels":["branding","business fundamentals","company growth","marketing","product growth","product management","sales"]},{"body":"","title":"Year-Over-Year Explained With Its Pros and Cons","url":"https:\/\/www.thebalance.com\/year-over-year-yoy-growth-calculation-definition-3305970","labels":[]},{"body":"","title":"Get to know your user: personas & jobs to be done.","url":"https:\/\/blog.prototypr.io\/30dayuxchallenge-day-5-get-to-know-your-user-personas-jobs-to-be-done-d0c272ffed58","labels":[]},{"body":"","title":"Do NOT raise VC funding\u200a\u2014\u200aThe 3 main reasons against it.","url":"https:\/\/hackernoon.com\/do-not-raise-vc-funding-3-reasons-against-it-7c5f6d4efbec","labels":[]},{"body":"","title":" Creative Ways To Identify New Market Segments","url":"https:\/\/www.quicktapsurvey.com\/blog\/creative-ways-to-identify-new-market-segments\/","labels":["branding","business fundamentals","interpersonal skills","marketing","product management","sales"]},{"body":"","title":"What is the Product-Market Fit and How to Measure It","url":"https:\/\/uxplanet.org\/what-is-the-product-market-fit-and-how-to-measure-it-b5bb3db07dae","labels":["product management","sales"]},{"body":"","title":"How Industry Leading Brands Use Content To Drive Lead Generation","url":"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/lead-generation\/how-industry-leading-brands-use-content-to-drive-lead-generation","labels":["company culture"]},{"body":"","title":"How to Pick a Co-Founder","url":"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2011\/02\/how-to-pick-a-co-founder","labels":["company culture"]},{"body":"","title":"Fun is the best driver of viral growth.","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/lightspeed-venture-partners\/fun-is-the-best-driver-of-viral-growth-664424a41ff7","labels":["company growth","product growth"]},{"body":"","title":"The 6 Key Traits of Highly Effective Account Managers","url":"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/agency\/traits-account-managers","labels":["marketing","product management"]},{"body":"","title":"What Is Lean Startup Methodology \u2013 And How Can It Help You?","url":"https:\/\/www.startups.co\/articles\/lean-startup-methodology-can-help","labels":["startup fundamentals"]},{"body":"","title":"5 Must-Have Skills Startup Founders Can't Live Without","url":"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/sangram-vajre\/5-must-have-skills-startup-founders-cant-live-without.html","labels":["interpersonal skills","startup fundamentals"]},{"body":"","title":"What Is Employee Experience?","url":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/jacobmorgan\/2016\/04\/22\/what-is-employee-experience\/#3297f1e7386c","labels":["people management"]},{"body":"","title":"What Is a Product Manager, Actually?","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@Alex.Valaitis\/what-is-a-product-manager-actually-f328f05575","labels":["product management"]},{"body":"","title":"Boxology: The Mythical Science of Organizational Change","url":"http:\/\/alignorg.com\/library\/resource\/boxology-the-mythical-science-of-organizational-change\/","labels":["interpersonal skills"]},{"body":"The Power of Bad Product Ideas\r\n\r\nBY CHRIS MASSEY ON MARCH 6, 2017\r\n\r\nSteve Portigal challenges product managers to re-think the idea-generation process by inviting in bad ideas.\r\n\r\nIn brain-storming sessions, we frequently see two surges in ideas. The first is where the low hanging fruit is identified. The second surge is where more innovative ideas are frequently found. Welcoming bad ideas can be an effective strategy for fast tracking past the low hanging fruit and into innovation.\r\n\r\nSteve\u2019s interactive talk encourages product managers to come up with the worst product ideas possible. Not the ideas that are just not that good, but ones that are really, truly terrible. By starting with a bad idea, Steve opens a safe, creative space for ideas sharing. He helps product people to unpack what is good and bad, why and who gets to decide. He encourages us to step away from the binary of good and bad to move around the problem space in a different way. His bad ideas approach also breaks the idea-generation ice \u2013 by starting with something terrible, space is opened for all ideas, allowing creativity to flow.\r\n\r\nSharing Terrible Ideas\r\n\r\nSteve identifies two types of bad idea sharing, proactive disruption vs tentative unfinished ideas \u2013 and encourages us to recognise and support those who share both. The first type of sharing breaks open space for a different approach to your problem or market. The second invites you to listen, collaborate and make a bad thing good.\r\n\r\nBad ideas expose our own beliefs about what the criteria are for good and bad and force us to reassess. Bad ideas can go good, context is everything and ultimately bad can only be judged by the marketplace. If an idea is stupid but it works, its not stupid.\r\n\r\nSteve\u2019s talk encourages you to be open to surprises and to capture new energy in your team by being playful with the ideas generation process and laughing as you go.\r\n\r\nShare Share +1 Email Shares 163","title":"The Power of Bad Product Ideas","url":"http:\/\/www.mindtheproduct.com\/2017\/03\/power-bad-product-ideas","labels":["agile principles","product discovery","product growth","product management","sales"]},{"body":"","title":"[Pt. 1] Which Methodology Should You \u2018Hire\u2019 to Apply Jobs to be Done?","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/frameplay\/which-methodology-should-you-hire-to-apply-jobs-to-be-done-pt-1-f24baff27b21","labels":["agile principles","business fundamentals","product management","startup fundamentals"]},{"body":"","title":"Generating Startup Ideas","url":"http:\/\/marcbarros.com\/generating-startup-ideas\/","labels":["agile principles","startup fundamentals"]},{"body":"","title":"How Marketing Research Can Benefit A Small Business","url":"https:\/\/smallbiztrends.com\/2006\/01\/how-marketing-research-can-benefit-a-small-business.html","labels":["business fundamentals","marketing"]},{"body":"","title":"Growth Hacking: How to Implement an A\/B Testing Model","url":"http:\/\/www.coxblue.com\/growth-hacking-how-to-implement-an-ab-testing-model\/","labels":["product discovery","product growth"]},{"body":"Searching for Product\/Market Fit\r\n\r\nBY CHRIS MASSEY ON JUNE 7, 2016\r\n\r\nRodrigo Madanes has got 25 years of experience designing and developing successful web and mobile products at companies such as Skype and eBay. Rodrigo will talk about exploring product\/market Fit, sharing his lessons learned about first focusing on the needs of a specific user segment. Rodrigo dives into what it means to find product\/market fit, some techniques for finding it, and how long it can take. By way of example: At Skype, in their early-adopter phase, they still had 40-50 million registered users. The wave can take 10-15 years, and it\u2019s not about size of user base.\r\n\r\nHow Do You Recognise Product\/Market Fit?\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re sensible, after launching your product you\u2019ll spend some time searching for product\/market Fit before you try and aggressively take what you believe your market to be. But working out when you have product\/market fit is a tricky thing. Having a growing user base doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you\u2019re solving a real problem for a defined market, or that you\u2019ve built something that people actually want \u2013 it might just mean that you have great marketing.\r\n\r\nSize of user-base isn\u2019t actually that helpful, so you need to try and look for other behaviours and, more importantly, more specific segments of your audience. Do you get a lot of return visitors? Do you have good Net Promoter Scores? Are your users giving you money? Do you have stable cohort retention curves? These are the signs that indicate a potential product\/market fit!\r\n\r\nOnce you\u2019ve found that fit, then you should go out and find all the people who make up that audience, and finally take the market. As observed by Marc Andreessen, a startup really has two very different phases of existence \u2013 Before Fit and After Fit \u2013 and thus two different sets of goals and behaviours. Don\u2019t get those two mixed up.\r\n\r\nWhat Next?\r\n\r\nTaking this a step further, you need to find the specific set of features that matters to a specific, defined market, then work out exactly how to reach that market (i.e. which channels to use) and invest just in those! However, you\u2019ll likely find, as most startups do, that although you\u2019ll get a ramp-up in users when you hit product\/market fit, your growth will gradually plateau. It\u2019s important to remember that growth is bumpy, and as your first product\/market fit growth spurt starts to slow, you should already be looking into the next set of features that will trigger another round of fit-based growth.\r\n\r\nNext, it\u2019s important to focus on the intensity of NPS (or some other measure of user love for your product). Put simply, if you try and build something for everyone, you\u2019ll build something that\u2019s great for nobody. Focus on the users who really love your product, and build for them, as they\u2019re more likely to be a defined market, and they\u2019re more likely to help you grow.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, on the topic of defined markets, focus on specific segments of your potential audience. Realistically, your audience is a complex and multi-faceted mess of different types of people, so you need to investigate (using things like cohort analysis and segmentation) to work out exactly what defines your market (e.g. what mobile platform they\u2019re using, location, wealth, life stages\u2026), and then work out how to reach them.\r\n\r\nShare Share +1 Email Shares 83","title":"Searching for Product\/Market Fit","url":"http:\/\/www.mindtheproduct.com\/2016\/06\/searching-product-market-fit","labels":["product management","sales"]},{"body":"","title":"How Does Whatsapp Make Money?

And while passion for an idea or ideal is generally considered a requirement for launching a startup, is it really as necessary as founders think?\r\n\r\nIn this syndicated post, Benjamin Chong, a Partner at Right Click Capital and Co-Director of the Sydney Founder Institute, explains why following your passion is an admirable yet misguided notion, and what founders should strive for instead.\r\n\r\nThe post, \"Is it all about passion?\", originally appeared on Benjamin Chong's Blog and has been republished below with permission.\r\n\r\nPassion makes for success. Without passion you\u2019ll fail. If you don\u2019t have passion about what you\u2019re doing, you won\u2019t do it for long. We\u2019ve all heard these catch phrases, and while they sound good, I\u2019ve had a niggling suspicion in the back of my mind that it doesn\u2019t always work that way. I\u2019ve seen salesmen with loads of passion fail in closing deals. I\u2019ve seen actors with passion for their craft fail in getting work. I\u2019ve seen speakers who are passionate about a cause fail to mount cogent arguments.\r\n\r\nWhile I was growing up, my parents sent me to music lessons. Every week, I remember going to my piano teacher\u2019s studio where she\u2019d have me play scales and pieces I had practiced during the week. On weeks where I had slacked off, my teacher would ask if I had practiced. I\u2019d say \u201cyes\u201d, to which she\u2019d reply, \u201cI can hear you haven\u2019t practiced this week\u201d. If, as a kid, you\u2019d asked me whether I was passionate about music, I don\u2019t think my answer would have been a resounding yes, but as the years of practice added up, I got better and better, and while I\u2019m certainly no concert pianist, I now say I\u2019m passionate about music in general, and piano music in particular.\r\n\r\nCal Newport\u2019s book, So Good They Can\u2019t Ignore You, deals with this very topic. He dispels the popular concept that you need to find your passion before you launch your career. Instead, he spells out the importance of following four simple rules that\u2019ll put you on the right trajectory. Each of these rules isn\u2019t revolutionary, but when combined, they make up a sensible and coherent action plan no matter what your career.\r\n\r\nThe first rule is don\u2019t follow your passion. In this section, Cal strongly argues following your passion is bad advice, especially when you\u2019re passionate about a field you have limited experience with.\r\n\r\nIn this section, Cal strongly argues following your passion is bad advice, especially when you\u2019re passionate about a field you have limited experience with. The second rule is be so good that they can\u2019t ignore you. Here, Cal puts forward a number of examples of successful individuals who have honed their skills through deliberate practice. He recalls the 10,000 hour rule made famous by Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s book,Outliers, whereby those who are experts in the field, be it music, sport, or business have spent 10,000 hours developing their craft.\r\n\r\nHere, Cal puts forward a number of examples of successful individuals who have honed their skills through deliberate practice.

Control here is key, as is having the freedom to take little bets in exploring and experimenting with areas of interest. He also stresses the importance of continual improvement noting that so many people stop learning and stretching themselves once they\u2019ve found a comfortable job.\r\n\r\nCal argues it\u2019s important for skilful people to be deliberate about how and where they direct their efforts.

In this section, Cal provides examples of other successful people who have \u2018discovered\u2019 their big and challenging missions after they\u2019ve developed a high level of domain knowledge and cultivated rare skills. One of my favourite quotes of this section is \u201cworking right trumps funding right work\u201d.\r\n\r\nAfter reading So Good They Can\u2019t Ignore You, I can see parallels in my own life. My passion for music seems to have come about repeated and deliberate (at least on my parents\u2019 part) exposure from a young age. I received ongoing encouragement with provided additional motivation to practice more, becoming more confident and playing (and enjoying) different genres. In other fields, I\u2019m now more motivated to spend time deliberately practicing and developing my skills, applying some of the author\u2019s other rules.\r\n\r\n(Man showing a red heart shaped box image by StockUnlimited)","title":"Do You Really Need Passion to Launch a Startup? The Answer May Surprise You","url":"http:\/\/FI.co\/posts\/22201","labels":["startup fundamentals"]},{"body":"","title":"What Employees Want From the Performance Management Process","url":"https:\/\/www.td.org\/insights\/what-employees-want-from-the-performance-management-process","labels":["people management"]},{"body":"What Do Boards Actually Do?\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a lot of mystique about what happens at board meetings and a lot of imagined board-room drama. I read commentary or Twitter or blogs and realize that there are also strongly held convictions that there are these evil VCs who do terrible things to mostly altruistic founders.\r\n\r\nThe image of boards and of investors vs. founder conflicts has been so at odds with my experiences on dozens of boards over the past 20 years that I thought it was worth sharing what I actually see.\r\n\r\nAs a starting point the board is intended to have legal and financial responsibilities to a few key constituencies: shareholders, debt holders, creditors, employees, government and major parties with whom the business operates.\r\n\r\nIn some ways being a board member is like how I\u2019ve heard people describe learning to become a pilot: Many hours of boredom followed by some brief moments of absolute panic and fear. In fact, as one Twitter commenter observed to what do board do, \u201cOften, not much.\u201d That\u2019s true. Executives run the day-to-day so often the board is more involved as a sparring partner at key intervals.\r\n\r\nThe administrative work we actually do at board meetings?\r\n\r\nAgreeing an annual budget\r\n\r\nSetting a 409a valuation used to price stock options\r\n\r\nAgreeing stock option allocations\r\n\r\nReviewing financial performance\r\n\r\nTalking about the organizational structure and where we need to bolster things\r\n\r\nDiscussing sales & marketing strategies, product launches, technical challenges\r\n\r\nTalking about law suits (patents, trademarks, employee disputes)\r\n\r\nAnd so forth\r\n\r\nBetween board meetings we do calls to discuss performance or major initiatives. Often we are asked to get involved in executive-level recruiting. And of course we help with business development introductions and with fund raising events.\r\n\r\nBoard work does involve a lot of conflict at moments throughout the company. Sometimes conflict comes because a company isn\u2019t hitting its expected targets and investors vs. executives have different views in the causes or the consequences of under-performance. Sometimes conflict comes because executives want to increase personal compensation and investors aren\u2019t in favor of this. Sometimes it comes because investors believe the company needs more experienced leadership to run the company or more often to help run the company.\r\n\r\nBut unlike the popular press reporting of this conflict \u2014 80% of the time it is founder-to-founder conflict and not investor-to-founder conflict. The overwhelming majority of conflicts that I\u2019ve seen on boards over the years are a result of the tensions of either:\r\n\r\nunderperformance of a company in which executives blame the action of each other or specific individuals\r\n\r\nfounders or senior executives in a company upset that they don\u2019t have the right role, title or compensation\r\n\r\norganizational changes in a company initiated by the CEO that leaves somebody in the company being unhappy\r\n\r\ndifferent risk expectations founders have with each other: Raise more vs. raise less, engage in M&A vs. fund raise, grow faster with higher burn or cut costs and focus on profitability, etc.\r\n\r\nIn nearly 20 years of sitting on boards I have seen:\r\n\r\nFounders trying to fire other co-founders\r\n\r\nCompanies revolting against the founder & CEO and asking for the board\u2019s help\r\n\r\nFounders physically threatening other co-founders or employees\r\n\r\nSubstance abuse\r\n\r\nMajor problems with depression and dysfunction at the executive level\r\n\r\nOf course I\u2019m not saying most founders have problems \u2014 I\u2019m just pointing out that when you\u2019re involved with scores of companies you see every kind of human behavior. But importantly non-founders who are often major contributors to the success of a company and would be interested to know that it\u2019s not unheard of to see founders\r\n\r\nAsk for major top-ups of their personal equity while not having commensurate top-ups for rank-and-file executives\r\n\r\nMajor squandering of company resources on travel & entertainment that isn\u2019t in support of company goals\r\n\r\nProfligate spending with limited regard for future fund raising that causes major dilution when funds are raised at the last minute\r\n\r\nI point out the worst that I\u2019ve seen in 20 years for a reason. Boards are not appointed to be founder-friendly lapdogs for the 1\u20133 founders who start companies and usually own the largest equity positions in the company. Boards are fiduciaries to represent the interest of all shareholders \u2014 big and small \u2014 and this includes employees who bet with their careers and with reduced pay in order to have equity they hope will be valuable.\r\n\r\nTo be clear \u2014 most founders I\u2019ve ever worked with have been super ethical, very conscientious, not overly greedy and take their personal responsibilities very seriously. I also want to be clear that some investor board members can act like total jerks at times.\r\n\r\nI am usually loyal to the founders I\u2019ve backed above all else. I consider myself founder friendly. I will work evenings or weekends to help a founder in need. I prefer to leave the passionate, mission-driven founder in charge for as long as is possible. If the founder has limitations in running a company I will normally try any other option other than removing them from the CEO role. And if I believe they aren\u2019t the best suited person to run the company I will always sit down and walk the founder through why I believe the company might be better suited with somebody else at the helm. I will see if I can get him or her to see this herself.\r\n\r\nBut in the end \u2014 a board\u2019s ultimate loyalty must be to the company and all of its shareholders. The board is there to represent the interests of all shareholders & creditors and to put the interests of the company before their own interests. At times being \u201cfounder friendly\u201d can mean protecting many founders from a CEO or it can even mean providing tough guardrails to protect a CEO\u2019s own personal interests from his or her worst instincts. I saw this first hand with a CEO who tried to get into numerous company-betting lawsuits that we knew weren\u2019t in his best interest.\r\n\r\nWhat prompted this post? It has nothing to do with any individual company. I have been meaning to write this for a while as I\u2019ve noticed that much of my board time is involved in trying to be an independent referee for founders who themselves are trying to resolve their own conflicts. Those seldom get reported.\r\n\r\nThe rise of crowd funding saw the first wave of founders gleeful that they could raise capital without having to deal with terrible VCs. I think we\u2019re far enough into this trend to see that having strong board members \u2014 including VCs \u2014 is a healthy alternative to party-rounds of crowd funding with no oversight.\r\n\r\nLately I\u2019ve noticed that there is a second wave that many fantasize about a world in which ICOs drive all funding and founders and employees never have to deal with venture capitalists. ICOs certainly have a place in startup financing.\r\n\r\nBut having a board of directors and having some of those board members be large financial owners in the business with shared corporate governance forces a tension in businesses that I believe is healthy. This is similar to the role that public markets play in helping shape publicly traded companies. At times I\u2019m sure it feels terrible to be a publicly traded company but ultimately I believe the sunshine of publicly reported numbers produces better results. So, too, a healthy and skeptical board.\r\n\r\nPhoto credit: jpeepz via VisualHunt \/ CC BY-NC","title":"What Do Boards Actually Do?","url":"https:\/\/bothsidesofthetable.com\/what-do-boards-actually-do-9c278e81da5f","labels":[]},{"body":"","title":"Never, Ever Compromise: Hiring For Culture Fit","url":"http:\/\/blog.eladgil.com\/2012\/04\/never-ever-compromise-hiring-for.html","labels":["company culture"]}]
